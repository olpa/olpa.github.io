<p>To my surprise, symbolic and hard links are partially supported even by windows 2000. Here is a small summary:</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>``<a href="http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=341355">How to create a symbolic link under Win2K, WinXP, and above?</a>'' -- this google-answers document was my starting point.</p>
<p>My notes:</p>
<p><b>CreateHardLink</b> function establishes a hard link between an existing file and a new file. This function is only supported on the NTFS file system, and only for files, not directories.</p>
<p><b>CreateSymbolicLink</b> function creates a symbolic link. Requires Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008.</p>
<p>And finally, <b>junctions</b> or <b>reparse points</b> (from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/fileio/fs/reparse_points.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/fileio/fs/reparse_points.asp</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>A file or directory can contain a reparse point, which is a collection of user-defined data. The format of this data is understood by the application which stores the data, and a file system filter, which you install to interpret the data and process the file. </p></blockquote>
<p>This feature can be used to create links to directories. It is exactly what I need!</p>
<p>The tool to exploit the feature: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/FileAndDisk/Junction.mspx">Junction v1.05</a>.</p>
