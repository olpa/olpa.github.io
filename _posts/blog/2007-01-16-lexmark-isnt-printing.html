<p>After returning from holidays, I found that printer doesn't print anymore. After some investigation, I found that <tt>dmesg</tt> contains:</p>
<pre>usb 2-1: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 7
usb 2-1: device not accepting address 7, error -71
usb 2-1: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 8
usb 2-1: device descriptor read/64, error -71</pre>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Possible reasons and solutions:</p>
<p>* Linux USB Frequently Asked Questions. <a href="http://www.linux-usb.org/FAQ.html#ts6">Why doesn't USB work at all? I get "device not accepting address".</a><br />
* <a href="http://www.linux-usb.org/notAcceptFeedback.html">Various users have had success with some specific strategy.</a></p>
<p>It seems I need a Windows friend to come and attach the printer to his notebook. This way I'll know where is the source of the problem:</p>
<p>* the USB system is broken on my notebook, or<br />
* the USB connection with the printer is bad.</p>
