<p>For a few days, smtp.gmail.com has a bad SSL certificate. As result, some well-behaved mail clients and transfer agents can't send mail to and from GMail. Quite possible, it's the answer for a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/Gmail-Problem-solving/browse_thread/thread/8cfc68ceed05f63b">report</a> that messages from HotMail to GMail are not delivered.</p>
