<p>In libxml2, C calls</p>
<pre>
xmlNewPI("name", NULL);
xmlNewPI("name", "");
</pre>
<p>produce the following processing instructions</p>
<pre>
&lt;?name?>
&lt;?name ?>
</pre>
<p>(notice the space in the second case). At the first moment I though that I shouldn't allow the first variant. But then reminded that in XML absence of node and empty node are sometimes very different things. So let both variants be.</p>
<p>Then I tested two variants for another node type:</p>
<pre>
xmlNewComment(NULL);
xmlNewComment("");
</pre>
<p>The second case produced the expected result</p>
<pre>&lt;----></pre>
<p>but the first variant seems broken. In serialized XML, I have no comments at all!</p>
<p>Anyway, I decided to have difference between nothing and empty string. I feel it can be used somehow,</p>
