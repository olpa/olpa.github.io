<p>All blogging tips recommend to have the full RSS feeds. To my unpleasant surprise, I found that my feeds are partial, disrespecting the option "Full text" is set. The explanation is simple.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>The comment next to the option says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Note: If you use the <tt>&lt;!--more--></tt> feature, it will cut off posts in RSS feeds.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think WordPress didn't have this misfeature initially, but it was introduced during upgrades.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I've found a solution:</p>
