<p>The best place to analyze log files is the local computer, not the server:<br />
1) Log files grow fast, taking all the server space<br />
2) Queries might be CPU-intensite<br />
If you like me, you prefer that the log files appear on the local computer automatically.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2>Server setup</h2>
<p>At the moment "X-1", the server logs are truncated, and the collected data is put to a separate file.</p>
<p>Note that the setup consists of two parts, one is "at the moment..." and another one is "the server logs...". The both tasks are solved using the standard tools.</p>
<p>The latter task is called "log rotation", and the usual tool is "<tt>logrotate</tt>". In the easiest case, you already have the config file "<tt>/etc/logrotate.d/httpd</tt>", which defines how to rotate web server logs and has an entry for the default web server.</p>
<p>By analogue, add entries for your sites. You'll get something like this:</p>
<pre><code>/home/uucode/logs/*log ...other sites... {
    daily
    missingok
    notifempty
    sharedscripts
    postrotate
        /bin/kill -USR1 `cat /var/run/httpd.pid 2>/dev/null`
                         2> /dev/null || true
    endscript
}</code></pre>
<p>Logrotate is executed from <tt>cron</tt>. On modern Linux systems, there is a small infrastructure. Running <tt>logrotate</tt> is the task of <tt>/etc/cron.daily/logrotate</tt>. Running the directory <tt>/etc/cron.daily/</tt> is specified in the file <tt>/etc/crontab</tt>.</p>
<p>Set the time "X-1" in <tt>/etc/crontab</tt>. Don't forget about timezones!</p>
<h2>Local setup</h2>
<p>I haven't found a standard tool, therefore have written a Python script. Here is its functionality:</p>
<p>* Download the latest rotated log "<tt>xxx.1</tt>" from the server and save it as "<tt>xxx</tt>". (Obviously, I use <tt>rsync</tt> and key authentifications.)</p>
<p>* If the local files "<tt>xxx</tt>" and "<tt>xxx.1</tt>" are the same, it means that the log was already downloaded, and there is nothing to do. Exit.</p>
<p>* Otherwise,<br />
. - rename "<tt>xxx.1</tt>" to something like "<tt>xxx-2007MMDD-HHMM</tt>"<br />
. - copy "<tt>xxx</tt>" to "<tt>xxx.1</tt>"</p>
<p>As result, we always have the latest rotated log "<tt>xxx</tt>", a copy of it ("<tt>xxx.1</tt>") to simplify programming and the set of timestamped old logs.</p>
<p>The script is executed from <tt>cron</tt> at the moment "X-45min".</p>
<p>At the moment "X" I start to work and can check the new logs.</p>
