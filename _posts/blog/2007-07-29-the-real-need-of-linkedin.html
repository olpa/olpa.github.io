<p>Many conferences create and share the list off all the participants. Before, I had a problem: I was not able to make an use of this list, and was not able to through it away (too valuable resource). And now I know what to do. I scan the list, find those who communicated with me, and create connections on linkedin. Fine. By the way, here is <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/olegparashchenko">my profile</a>.</p>
