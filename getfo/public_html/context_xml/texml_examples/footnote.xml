When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived
alone, in the woods, a mile from any neighbor, in a house which I had
built myself, or the shore of Walden Pond, in Concord, Massachusetts,
and earned my living by the labor of my hands only. I lived there two
years and two months. At present I am a sojourner in civilized life
again.

    <parm>Thoreau started writing
    <group><cmd name="sl" gr="0"/>Walden</group> 
    in 1846, a few months after he started living
    at Walden Pond. He moved back to Concord late in 1847. By that point he
    had drafted half of the manuscript. He continued to work on it for
    several years.
