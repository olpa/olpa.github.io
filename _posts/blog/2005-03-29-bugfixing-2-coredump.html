<p>Other two bugs (see "<a href="/blog/2005/03/29/xml-to-sxml-coredumped/">bug list</a>" and "<a href="/blog/2005/03/29/bugfixing-1-nulls/">bugfixing 1</a>") are interrelated. Use of the map is powerful, but dangerous.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>To remind:</p>
<blockquote><p>1) ... but I want to check that I did't forget to use the map in the reverse (SXML to XML) conversion.</p></blockquote>
<p>No, I didn't forget.</p>
<blockquote><p>3) The real bug is coredumping on a certain construction. I stopped programming when I got coredump and can't say for sure, but I think I know the reason and solution in advance.</p></blockquote>
<p>The idea was wrong, but not very much wrong.</p>
<p>It was easy to make a test case:</p>
<pre>
&lt;s:scheme>
  (define x (x:current-node))
  x
&lt;/s:scheme>
</pre>
<p>I even did not debug this case. The problem is obvious. I'm inserting a subtree to the output document by reference. So I have the same subtree in the different trees. This is not supported by libxml2, it segfaults somewhere, probably when freeing the same block of memory once again.</p>
<p>After thinking some time I realized that code mustn't insert node by reference and there were only two solutions:<br />
* skip a node which is in the map,<br />
* make a copy of the node and add the copy.</p>
<p>I decided to follow the second way. I can't explain why, but it seems more reasonable for me.</p>
<p>By the way, code prints a warning message:</p>
<blockquote><p>scm_to_node: bounded node can't be added to tree, adding a free copy</p></blockquote>
