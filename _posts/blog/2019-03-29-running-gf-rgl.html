<p>The <a href="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/lib/doc/synopsis.html">GF Resource Grammar Library</a> is the standard library for <a href="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/">Grammatical Framework</a>. It covers the morphology and basic syntax of over 30 languages. The GF project is big, and it is hard for outsiders to start using GF-RGL. This post summarizes my first steps which can be repeated by others.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>First, GF self should be installed as described on its site. I used a deb-package, so that the executable is installed as `/usr/bin/gf`.</p>
<p>I cloned RGL from its git repository `<a href="https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/gf-rgl">https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/gf-rgl</a>`. My setup command was:</p>
<pre><code>
./Setup.sh --dest=~/opt/gf-rgl/opt --gf=/usr/bin/gf --verbose
</code></pre>
<p>Files were installed into the directory `~/opt/gf-rgl/opt`. To understand how to use them, I searched github for rgl projects and found <a href="https://github.com/odanoburu/gf-matrix">gf-matrix</a>. Again, cloned the repository and tried to make anything. The following commands worked:</p>
<pre><code>
export GF_LIB_PATH=/home/my-user-name/opt/gf-rgl/opt
make
</code></pre>
