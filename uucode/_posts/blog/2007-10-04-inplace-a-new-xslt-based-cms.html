<p>I've released a content management system for static pages:</p>
<blockquote><p>
InPlace CMS<br />
<a href="http://inplace.sourceforge.net/">http://inplace.sourceforge.net/</a></p>
<p>Use InPlace CMS to maintain a bundle of HTML pages in an uniform appearance. Adopt the light and agile approach to document a product or to create a mini-site. Target users are the developers of open source projects.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Everything is very simple, this tool is just a Python wrapper for XSLT, but:</p>
<p>* There is a big difference between "easy to do" and "is done, with documentation".<br />
* The main feature is the descritipion of use cases. They highlight why 99.99% of other CMS don't fit to the needs of the open source developers.<br />
* Also useful: patterns for simple templating tasks.</p>
<p>I use the tool for my own projects, and I'm very satisfied.</p>
