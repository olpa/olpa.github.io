<p>I like not to read from screen, but to print and read texts offline. Today I tried to print an usenet discussion from the Google groups interface. Unfortunately, there is no printer-friendly version, and copy-paste to OpenOffice is very ugly. Finally, I made copy-paste of text content of each message. Very frustrating.</p>
