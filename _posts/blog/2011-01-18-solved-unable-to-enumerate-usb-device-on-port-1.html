<p>At some moment, my USB WLAN stick stopped working, and the log was polluted by messages like:</p>
<pre>
usb 6-1: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 62
hub 6-0:1.0: unable to enumerate USB device on port 1
hub 6-0:1.0: unable to enumerate USB device on port 1
</pre>
<p>At first, I decided that the stick had broken after years of work, but out of curiousity tried to connect it to every USB port I found. It worked. The stick worked again when plugged into the keyboard, which in term was connected to the KVM.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>What is funny, I did nothing, but after a few days the stick worked again correctly in its original port. I forgot about the problem. But after yet another vacations, the problem appeared again, and again disappeared in a few days.</p>
<p>I have no idea why.</p>
<p>But I finally found a solution here: <a href="http://www.absolutelytech.com/2010/04/18/solved-unable-to-enumerate-usb-device-disabling-ehci_hcd/">[Solved] Unable to enumerate USB device (Disabling ehci_hcd)</a>. I need to disable <tt>ehci_hcd</tt>. In my case, the commands is:</p>
<pre>
# cd /sys/bus/pci/drivers/ehci_hcd
# echo -n "0000:00:1a.7" > unbind
</pre>
<p>As a side effect, I do not have USB 2.0 on this bus anymore, but it is not a problem.</p>
<h2>24.02.2010, update</h2>
<p>To issue the command automatically on boot, one could edit <tt>/etc/rc.local</tt>, but in my case I need to have network loaded before. The best solution (I hope) is based on advice here:</p>

<blockquote><p>
You can disable this on boot by creating a /etc/udev/rules.d/disable-ehci.rules file containing:</p>
<p><code />
<pre>
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="pci", DRIVER=="ehci_hcd", \
        RUN+="/bin/sh -c 'echo -n %k > %S%p/driver/unbind'"
</pre>
