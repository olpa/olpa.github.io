<p>I've noticed that results of pdfLaTeX and LaTeX plus dvipdf sometimes differ. One case is the color of an image.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Sample TeX file:</p>
<pre>
\\documentclass{article}
\\usepackage{graphicx}
\\usepackage{color}
\\begin{document}
\\textcolor{red}{Red Image? \\includegraphics{image} (end).}
\\end{document}
</pre>
<p>Files "image.eps" and "image.pdf" are black-white images. The results are the following:</p>
<p>pdfLaTeX: the image is red-white<br />
LaTeX+dvipdf: the image is black-white</p>
<p>I use quite old teTeX 2.0, and can't install a newer version to check if the inconsistency is fixed.</p>
<p>Is it a bug? If yes, where should I report it? Who is right, pdfLaTeX or LaTeX+dvipdf?</p>
