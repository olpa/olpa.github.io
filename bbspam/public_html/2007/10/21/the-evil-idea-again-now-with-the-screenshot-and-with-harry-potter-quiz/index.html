				<div class="KonaBody"><p>The post &#8220;<a href="../../../09/16/evil-idea-make-money-from-spammers/index.html#comment-70">Evil Idea: Make money from spammers!</a>&#8221; has raised a number of comments. The intermediate verdict is: &#8220;A bad idea if put into practice, not a bad idea in theory&#8221;. Probably I know the first step to refactor the idea. Let&#8217;s try this way:</p>
<p><span id="more-40"></span></p>
<p><img src='../../../../wp-content/uploads/2007/10/amazon-isbn.png' alt='ATC question about Harry Potter ISBN' title='ATC question about Harry Potter ISBN'  width="610" height="353" /></p>
<p>The question on screenshot is:</p>
<blockquote><p>What&#8217;s the ISBN of the book &#8220;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&#8221;? (Visit the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0545010225?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=xmlnewsandres-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=9325&#038;creativeASIN=0545010225">book&#8217;s page at Amazon</a> and search the page for the string &#8220;ISBN-10&#8221;. The digits is the answer.)</p></blockquote>
<p>And yes, the link is affiliate! If 80% of your visitors are spammers, they&#8217;ll visit Amazon and maybe buy something.</p>
<p>As long as Amazon doesn&#8217;t care how you redirect the visitors, you are happy. Unfortunately, I think it&#8217;s against theirs Terms of Service.</p>
<p>The second main problem is that this approach disturbs good visitors.</p>
<p>Personally, I care about the visitors more than about the terms of service. Therefore, I don&#8217;t consider this isbn-question seriously.</p>
<p>But if your site is devoted to Harry Potter, why not to reformulate the question?</p>
<blockquote><p>Who is the best friend of Harry Potter? (Read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0545010225?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=xmlnewsandres-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=9325&#038;creativeASIN=0545010225">the book</a> if you don&#8217;t know!)</p></blockquote>
<p>In my opinion, the good visitors will easily pass the question.</p>
<p>Such approach can work for any thematic forum.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
