<p>The title "<a href="http://uucode.com/texts/xfind/index.html">Find with XPath over file system</a>" is a bit misleading. It is not the first time when I've got a question like:</p>
<blockquote><p>When you say "The standard UNIX utility find now supports XPath", does that mean that this will be included in the standard find?</p></blockquote>
<p>Now <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/view/561">I've been asked</a> at <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/">Lambda the Ultimate</a> (and I like being noticed there).</p>
<p>The answer is:</p>
<blockquote><p>
No, it will never be included in the standard find: <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-findutils/2005-01/msg00107.html">http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-findutils/2005-01/msg00107.html</a>, and I completely agree.</p>
<p>It looks like the title is a bit misleading. I wanted to emphasize that I hadn't written a program from scratch, but added the XPath facility to a legacy code, and the legacy code is the standard find.
