<p>Life is strange. The serious software such as <a href="http://getfo.org/texml/">TeXML</a> or <a href="http://consodoc.com/">Consodoc</a> are used by few people only. The side-development, phpBB antispam, is more popular than all the other products together.</p>
<p><!--more-->></p>
<p><a href="http://bbantispam.com/tc/">Textual Confirmation</a> is <a href="http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=472940">included</a> into the official phpBB mods-database.</p>
<p>My site <a href="http://bbantispam.com/">bbAntiSpam.com</a> have got a similar looking competitor: <a href="http://phpbbantispam.com/">phpbbAntiSpam.com</a>.</p>
<p>Cracks started to appear.</p>
<p>At RentACoder, someone <a href="http://www.rentacoder.com/RentACoder/misc/BidRequests/ShowBidRequest.asp?lngBidRequestId=588519">asked</a> from phpBB customization, including re-implementation of Textual Confirmation.</p>
<p>Now I have near all the attributes of a successful shareware project. Unfortunately, I don't have the main one: income.</p>
