<p>Article isn't writing. Although, in general, I have ideas what to write, the actual writing is painfully slow. Today I've only finish a section, and I feel I'll rewrite it somewhen.</p>

<h2>SXML, the Lisp approach</h2>
<p>Lisp is a family of computer languages. The most popular<br />
dialects are Common Lisp (<em>ref</em>) and Scheme(<em>ref</em>).<br />
In Lisp, data is representing in so-called S-expressions(<em>ref</em>),<br />
or Symbolic Expressions, or &quot;sexps&quot;, defined recursively.</p>
<p>Just as XML, S-expressions can represent any data structures,<br />
including hierarchical, and Lisp is good in processing them.<br />
There are a lot of discussions on comparing S-expressions,<br />
Lisp and XML (for example, see <em>ref</em> and <em>ref</em>). In our work<br />
we use a combination of useful features of XML and Lisp worlds.</p>
<p>The most developed Lisp approach for XML processing is the<br />
SXML(<em>ref</em>) library for Scheme. It defines an XML representation<br />
in terms of S-expressions and provides a growing number of tools.</p>
<p>The SXML format uses lists to represent an XML tree. In each list,<br />
the first symbol is the name of an XML element node, and other<br />
list items are the children of the node. There is a set of<br />
special symbols to specify non-element XML nodes. For example,<br />
list of attributes is stored under the special symbol &quot;&#64;&quot;.</p>
<p>Here is the SXML representation of the sample XML document:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
(article (&#64; (id &quot;hw&quot;))
 (title &quot;Hello&quot;)
 (para  &quot;Hello &quot; (object &quot;World&quot;) &quot;!&quot;))
</pre>
<p>Some XML standards are adopted for SXML. For example, there is<br />
SSAX(<em>ref</em>), an XML parser in Scheme with SAX(<em>ref</em>) interface,<br />
SXPath(<em>ref</em>), an analogue of XPath, STX(<em>ref</em>), a compiler for a subset<br />
of XSLT, and there is possibility for (X)Querying XML in Scheme(<em>ref</em>).</p>
<p>A useful feature of SXML tools is possibility to mix processing<br />
enforced by a standard with procesing in Scheme. It can be used<br />
to write more expressive programs. For example, the paper &quot;SXSLT,<br />
manipulation language for SXML&quot;(<em>ref</em>) demonstrated practical<br />
tasks for which SXSLT suits better than XSLT.</p>
<p>While most of the SXML tools are just analogues of XML standards,<br />
some core XML standards are implemented without deviations. Among<br />
these tools are an XML parser and the txpath(<em>ref</em>) library for<br />
XPath processing.</p>
