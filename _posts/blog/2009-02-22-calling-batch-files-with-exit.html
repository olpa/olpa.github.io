<p>Consider '<tt>main.bat</tt>'</p>
<pre><code>
call child1.bat
call child2.bat
</code></pre>
<p>What happens after '<tt>child1.bat</tt>' is finished?</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>I reasonably expected that '<tt>child2.bat</tt>' is executed. In a ideal world, yes.</p>
<p>In the real world, the first script contains the command '<tt>exit</tt>', and this commands not only exists from '<tt>child1.bat</tt>', but also terminates '<tt>main.bat</tt>'. Therefore, '<tt>child2.bat</tt>' isn't executed. I don't have words to comment this behavior.</p>
<p>As a workaround, I constructed the following. Not sure it's correct, but right now it works for me.</p>
<pre><code>
start /B /wait child1.bat
start /B /wait child2.bat
</code></pre>
<p>And the order of the arguments is important. "<tt>/B wait</tt>" makes the trick, "<tt>/wait /B</tt>" doesn't.</p>
<p>From documentation:</p>
<p>* /B: Start application without creating a new window. The application has ^C handling ignored. Unless the application enables ^C processing, ^Break is the only way to interrupt the application<br />
* /WAIT: Start application and wait for it to terminate</p>
