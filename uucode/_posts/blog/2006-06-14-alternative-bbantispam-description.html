<p>Recently I submitted <a href="http://bbantispam.com/">bbAntiSpam</a> to <a href="http://www.phpbbhacks.com/">phpBBHacks.com</a>, and now it is <a href="http://www.phpbbhacks.com/download/6643">accepted</a>. The site owners, however, have re-written the description:</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<blockquote><p>
This hack makes it so that unregistered users cannot post links (including e-mail addresses).</p>
<p>Each time a spam post is detected, the script will send a notification to the administrator and to the author of this hack. The data sent is the post content and the IP of the person who made the post. This data is used to improve the hack.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I like the text. Thanks, phpBBHacks!</p>
<p>By the way, during the last 3 days, bbAntiSpam has stopped more than 700 spam posts on my forum.</p>
