<p>I've just added a new blog category titled "<a href="/blog/category/xsieve/">XSieve</a>". It is result of extracting a subtopic of the topic "<a href="/blog/category/gpxml/">generative xml</a>". The project XSieve have raised an interest, so the project notes should not be hidden between other posts.</p>
