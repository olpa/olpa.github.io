<p>The Linux command line and other software based on <tt>readline</tt> library support <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/bash-vi-editing-mode-cheat-sheet">vi editing mode</a>. After I worked on a new system with the default settings for a while, I noticed that I miss this mode very much.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>It took some time to remember how I setup it on the main system. Grepping files for the line "<tt>set -o vi</tt>" has given nothing. Finally, I found that the solution is very nice and probably not described anywhere.</p>
<p>The file "<tt>/etc/inputrc</tt>" should contain the line:</p>
<pre><code>C-[: vi-movement-mode</code></pre>
<p>Now, initially, the input works as usual. But when I press the button <tt>ESC</tt>, the input switches to the vi mode.</p>
