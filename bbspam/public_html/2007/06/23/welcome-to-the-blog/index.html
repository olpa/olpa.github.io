While working on the tools and marketing them, I sometimes find very useful and interesting resources, and I&#8217;d like to share the link. Before, I wrote about findings in bbAntiSpam forums, but my postings were lost in the support requests. Now, I finally started this blog.</p>
<p>Actually, there is a number of blogs which cover the spambot topic. Some of them are in the blogroll. But I&#8217;m sure that bbSpam blog will get the leading position fast because I have a lot to say, many opinions are based on <i>experience</i> and, what also counts, I&#8217;m going to promote the blog.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to be the only author and I plan to hire a pair of assistants. The idea is that one person can&#8217;t cover everything. Worse, one person can overlook an interesting topic. Therefore, new authors are always welcome. If you want to say anything, don&#8217;t hesitate to contact me, I&#8217;ll create an account for you. Self-promotion is ok if it is written in the human language, not in the marketing language.</p>
<p>My name is Oleg, e-mail address is &lt;olpa bbspam com>. Contact me now!</p>
