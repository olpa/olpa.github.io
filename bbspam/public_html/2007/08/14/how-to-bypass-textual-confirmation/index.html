				<div class="KonaBody"><p>Someone has asked Google how to bypass Textual Confirmation. Great! The alternative to CAPTCHA is taking off, even spammers noticed it. Now they&#8217;ve started to think about bypassing. Would you mind to help them and share ideas?</p>
<p><span id="more-22"></span></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mind. As I wrote on the homepage of Advanced Textual Confirmation:</p>
<blockquote><p>
To pass ATC, spammers will have to collect a database of questions and answers. This work requires a human. Even if spammers pay as low as 1 cent per forum, 100,000 forums will cost them $1,000. And database maintenence is even more costly.</p>
<p>So, for spammer it is much more profitable to skip the sites protected by ATC. It will be cheaper and easier to spam an unprotected one.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Do you understand it, spammers?</p>
<p>By the way, anyone has other ideas about bypassing?</p>

<p>Textual Confirmation, unlike Advanced Textual Confirmation, is a bit weak due to question ID theft. Explanations are at the end of this post: <a href="../../../09/23/how-does-advanced-textual-confirmation-work/index.html" rel="nofollow">How does Advanced Textual Confirmation work</a>.</p>
