<p>It looks there is a need for a converter from CALS tables to LaTeX. Here is <a href="http://www.google.com/groups?selm=d61n1i%247fh%241%40news1.ewetel.de">yet another ask</a> in <tt>comp.text.tex</tt>. Jonathan Fine <a href="http://www.google.com/groups?selm=4285A77D.6070502%40pytex.org">answers</a> a bit enigmatic, and I <a href="http://www.google.com/groups?selm=de21d442.0505231321.5124cc90%40posting.google.com">answer</a> pessimistic.</p>

<p>I wrote:</p>
<p>I harly believe in such a script. First, there are issues with tables support in LaTeX. Second, CALS tables can be very complicated. Even mature tools don't support the standard in full.</p>
<p>Anyway, such tools exist.</p>
<p>* Some time ago I wrote an XSLT for CALS to TeXML conversion. It even worked for spanned columns and rows, but I finally have thrown the script off. I'm going to try again with more powerful conversion tools, but I don't know when.</p>
<p>* An XSLT converter from David Hedley: <a href="http://www.vistair.com/newtbl/XSLTableCode.html">http://www.vistair.com/newtbl/XSLTableCode.html</a></p>
<p>* I remember a Perl converter from SGML CALS tables, but I don't remember an URL.</p>
<h2>Update</h2>
<p>The same day, now in the xsl list: <a href="http://www.biglist.com/lists/xsl-list/archives/200505/msg01077.html">CALS table model to HTML table conversion</a></p>
<h2>15 Oct 2010, Update</h2>
<p>CTAN now has the package <a href="http://tug.ctan.org/pkg/cals">cals</a>, which is exactly for CALS tables.</p>
