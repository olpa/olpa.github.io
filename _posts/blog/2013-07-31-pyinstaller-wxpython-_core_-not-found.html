<p>Sometimes an error and the error message are different things. One of the examples is that my wxpython-program did not want to start after converting to exe using pyinstaller:</p>
<p><code>
<pre>ImportError: No module named _core_</pre>
<p></code></p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>The two confusing things for me were:</p>
<p>* Some time ago the exe-version worked<br />
* There is a file <tt>wx._core_.pyd</tt> in the program's directory</p>
<p>And a minimal test example worked again!</p>
<p>After some meditation, the root of the problem was found:</p>
<p><code>
<pre>
import sys
reload(sys)
sys.setdefaultencoding('utf-8')
</pre>
<p></code></p>
<p>More precisely, "<tt>reload</tt>" does not work with PyInstaller. At the moment I don't know a good solution and just have commented out the problem line.</p>
