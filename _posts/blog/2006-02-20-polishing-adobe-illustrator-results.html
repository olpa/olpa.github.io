<p>Adobe Illustrators seems to be a very good tool, even although I've never used it. Unfortunately, I have problems with AI results exported as SVG and EPS.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>One can't directly use SVG produced by AI due to wrong namespaces. I had to write a program, which corrects some issues I found:</p>
<p>* The program changes DOCTYPE with some old SVG public identifier to just "<code>&lt;!DOCTYPE svg [</code>".<br />
* The default namespace is set: <code>xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"</code><br />
* The namespace for xlink is defined: <code>xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"</code></p>
<p>Another set of problems can be found in EPS files. My users must have EPS with preview images. Unfortunately, <tt>epstopdf</tt> fails on such files. After some investigations I found that what AI produces is not an EPS file, but a DOS EPS file with some binary header.</p>
<p>To extract PostScript from a DOS EPS file, I found the program "<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsview/epstool.htm">epstool</a>". The most part of EPS files, filtered by <tt>epstool</tt>, is accepted by <tt>epstopdf</tt>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <tt>epstool</tt> rejects some DOS EPS files. I found out that it's because such files contain "<tt>%Trailer</tt>" too far from the end of the stream and "<tt>%EOF</tt>" isn't at the end of the stream. I don't know why. To workaround the problem, I patched <tt>epstool</tt> source code to lower severity of the error. Now conversion works well.</p>
<p>The patch file to use with "patch -p1":</p>
