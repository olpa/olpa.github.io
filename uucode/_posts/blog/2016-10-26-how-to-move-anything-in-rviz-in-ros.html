<p><a href="http://wiki.ros.org/rviz">Rviz</a> A 3d visualization environment for robots. Sounds intriguing and useful, but the first steps in it are painful. In particular, moving anything is surprisingly a very hard task for a novice who doesn't know about the right way. Now I have enough experience to describe what to do: <a href="http://github.com/olpa/motion-capture/tree/master/ros">Moving things in rviz</a>.</p>
