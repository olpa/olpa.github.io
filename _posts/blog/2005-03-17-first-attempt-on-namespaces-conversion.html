<p>The code splits an element's full name on two parts, looks up in the tree for ns prefix or ns URI and creates a ns definition if not found. There is also a draft code to check that ns definitions are complete.</p>
<p>I specified the algorithm of conversion in previous entries, but the simplest example have revealed two weak points.</p>
<p>Error 1.</p>
<pre>SXML: ... (a:b:c:d:doc "data") ...
XML: &lt;x>&lt;a:b:c:d:doc>data&lt;/a:b:c:d:doc>&lt;/x></pre>
<p>There is no namespace definition in the result and no any warning on the console. The error is that I check for ns completeness on returning from the attributes processing. In this case I have no attributes at all, and so have got no any warning.</p>
<p>Error 2.</p>
<p>The fake attributes set is added.</p>
<pre>SXML: ... (a:b:c:d:doc (@) "data") ...
XML: &lt;x xmlns:a:b:c:d="">&lt;a:b:c:d:doc>data&lt;/a:b:c:d:doc>&lt;/x></pre>
<p>The "xmlns" is attached to "x", not to "a:b:c:d". The reason is that ns definition can be created only together with attaching it to some node. I attach it to a context node, and at the moment when I'm going to create "doc", the context node is "x.</p>
<p>The funny thing is that "xmlNewNode" expects an already created ns definition, and "xmlNewNs" expects an already created node. Just a sort of circular reference. Fortunately, it seems that this loop can be broken by using "xmlSetNs" a posteriori. Will see later.</p>
