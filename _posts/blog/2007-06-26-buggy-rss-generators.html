<p>Just like the most of pseudo-XML tools, many RSS generators are buggy. For example, many just put the text into a CDATA section, without checking if it contains the sequence "]]>". As result, the feed might become invalid.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Recently I got a nice compaint from a <a href="http://tohtml.com/">tohtml.com</a> user. He spent <i>several hours</i> to find why his feed was invalid. Finally he found that he highlighted XML with a CDATA section and got "]]>", which broke the RSS.</p>
<p>I've followed the suggestion and introduced a workaround: my syntax highlighter now returns "]]&amp;gt;" instead of "]]>".</p>
