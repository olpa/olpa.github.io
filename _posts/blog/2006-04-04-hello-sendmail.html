<p>I've purchased a Virtual Private Server for my new project. The first thing to do is to make mail working. Initially, I want the most trivial setup: all domain mail should be forwarded to my gmail account.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>I've refreshed my sendmail skills. (When I was young, I came to our faculty computer center and said I want to become a system administrator. The answer was "Wonderful! Please install and configure sendmail for the faculty mail.")</p>
<p>Refreshing took some time, so I'm fixating the steps in the blog for future reference.</p>
<p>To ask sendmail to accept the mail for the domain, add to <tt>/etc/mail/local-host-names</tt> an entry:</p>
<pre>consodoc.com</pre>
<p>To forward domain mail to my gmail account, add to <tt>/etc/mail/virtusertable</tt> an entry:</p>
<pre>@consodoc.com   olepar@gmail.com</pre>
<p>Convert plain text to database:</p>
<pre># makemap hash /etc/mail/virtusertable.db &lt; /etc/mail/virtusertable</pre>
<p>The next step is to restart sendmail or to send SIGHUP signal. I don't need it because sendmail is run not as daemon, but from xinetd.</p>
<p>That's all.</p>
