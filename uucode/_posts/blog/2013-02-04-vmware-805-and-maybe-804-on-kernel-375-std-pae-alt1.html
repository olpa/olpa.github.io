<p>Each kernel upgrade causes a pain with vmware. This time (3.7.5 with PAE option) is not an exception. However, only two manual interventions were required to compile vmware kernel modules.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>1) As often, vmware can't find kernel headers. This time I can't blame vmware: it looks for "kernel.h", but this file is missed for some reason.</p>
<p>I've temporary copied it to the directory, where vmware looks for it (in my case).</p>
<pre><code>
cp /usr/src/linux-3.7.5-std-pae/include/generated/uapi/linux/version.h \
   /lib/modules/3.7.5-std-pae-alt1/build/include/linux
</code></pre>
<p>Now the system compiles the modules.</p>
<p>2) But loading of "Blocking file system" failed.</p>
<p>"dmesg" suggested that "vmblock.ko" contained an undefined reference to "putname". Internet suggested that the name should be "__putname".</p>
<p>* Re-start compilation of modules<br />
* Stop the process at some moment (Ctrl+Z)<br />
* Go to the compilation directory of the vmware (<tt>/tmp/.private/root/vmware-root/modules</tt>)<br />
* Delete vmblock.o<br />
* Go to the subdirectory "vmblock-only"<br />
* Say "make clean"<br />
* Find where "putname" is used (<tt>linux/control.c</tt>)<br />
* Change to "__putname", save<br />
* Say "make"<br />
* Find "vmblock.ko" and copy it to (in my case) "<tt>/lib/modules/3.7.5-std-pae-alt1/misc</tt>".<br />
* Continue vmware process ("fg")</p>
<p>Now vmware starts and works.</p>
<p>3) Delete no more needed file "version.h"</p>
