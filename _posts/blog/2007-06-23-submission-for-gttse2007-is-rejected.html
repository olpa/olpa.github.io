<p>Unfortunately, I'm not going to speak at <a href="http://wiki.di.uminho.pt/twiki/bin/view/Events/GTTSE2007/ParticipantsWorkshop">gttse'2007 participants workshop</a>. My extended abstract (<a href="http://xmlhack.ru/protva/recfree-xpath-abstract-gttse2007.pdf">Recursion-free XPath 1.0 implementation</a>) was rejected, the comment from the reviewers is below.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<blockquote><p>This is interesting, technical work which should be published somewhere. Unfortunately, the link to generative programming or software transformations is a bit too weak. Also, a 2 pages abstract should not be so technical but rather place the work in a context and clarify its originality. Also, the paper should say more clearly why "less recursion" is desirable. Finally, the paper comes a with "universal critique" of XPath papers; that's somewhat harsh and generic for a scientific publication. (There are normally reasonable reasons for abstracting away certain details in papers on XML.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, I agree to it (except the last two sentences). More, with the fresh look I found I mixed at least three things together:</p>
<p>* A cool technical development<br />
* Creating an use case for algebra of programming<br />
* "Universal critique" of XPath papers</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I got a nice question, what is the principal difference of my work and XQuery and XPath semantics. I feel there <i>is</i> difference, but I can't find it. Still thinking.</p>
