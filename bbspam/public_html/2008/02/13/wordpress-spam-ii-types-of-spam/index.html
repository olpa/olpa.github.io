				<div class="KonaBody"><p>I know 3 types of spam in WordPress, and speculate one more:</p>
<p>* comment spam<br />
* trackback (or pingback) spam<br />
* registration spam<br />
* plugin spam</p>
<p><span id="more-59"></span></p>
<p>The <b>comment spam</b> is well-known to any blogger. Without protection, the blog is doomed. Therefore, different antispam tools are used &#8212; <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a>, <a href="http://unknowngenius.com/blog/wordpress/spam-karma/">Spam Karma</a>, <a href="http://bbantispam.com/atc/">Advanced Textual Confirmation</a>, <a href="http://wp-plugins.net/category/SpamFighting/">a lot of others</a>, &#8212; with different efficiency and usability.</p>
<p>One can consider the <b>trackback spam</b> to be a subtype of the comment spam. Mostly because WordPress doesn&#8217;t make a big difference between them. But there <i>is</i> the big difference:</p>
<p>* Comments are supposed to be written by humans, but<br />
* trackbacks should appear automatically, without manual intervention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without manual intervention&#8221; means &#8220;without any control&#8221;. Too much good for the spammers. And due to the nature of the trackbacks, there is no easy solution. More on it later, please wait till I improve my note &#8220;<a href="http://uucode.com/blog/2008/01/15/decline-and-fall-of-the-trackbacks-rise-and-resurrection-of-the-trackbacks/">Decline and fall of the trackbacks; rise and resurrection of the trackbacks</a>&#8221;.</p>
<p>The <b>registration spam</b> is less known. You get one only if you create a community around the blog. As usual, for one good member you get a horde of spammers. I have no idea how people fight against this. On my blog, Advanced Textual Confrimation (ATC) works perfectly.</p>
<p>Finally, the <b>plugin spam</b>. I mention it for completeness. If you have a plugin which allows an user to publish something on the blog, you&#8217;ll get spam through this channel.</p>
