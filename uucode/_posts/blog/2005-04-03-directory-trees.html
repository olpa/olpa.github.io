<p>I've just stumbled upon a new article at xml.com: <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2005/03/30/tourist.html">Directory Trees to Document Trees</a>. I've posted a comment to the article and dropped a note to the author.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Here is my comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>
As the article mentions XML representation of a file system, I think that the following link is of high relevance and interest:</p>
<p>find with XPath over file system<br />
<a href="http://uucode.com/texts/xfind/index.html">http://uucode.com/texts/xfind/index.html</a></p>
<p>The standard UNIX utility find now supports XPath:</p>
<pre>
$ ./find -xpath '/bin/*[@size > /bin/bash/@size]'
/bin/ipv6calc
/bin/rpm
</pre>

<p>The author is John E. Simpson. His homepage is <a href="http://www.flixml.org/">http://www.flixml.org/</a>. Unfortunately, for some reason, the start page is empty. With words similar to the above, I notified him about the my development.</p>
