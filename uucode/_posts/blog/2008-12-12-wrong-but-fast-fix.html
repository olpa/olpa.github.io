<p>After a small system upgrade an application started to crash with the message:</p>
<pre>*** glibc detected *** sylpheed: double free or corruption (out): 0x0839e818 ***</pre>
<p>The right thing is to trace the application and submit a bug report to the author, but I found a fast workaround. Set an environment variable before running the program:</p>
<pre>export MALLOC_CHECK_=0</pre>
