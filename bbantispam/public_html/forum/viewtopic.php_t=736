				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">I have both files bbantispam.php and bbasconfig.php in the root of my forum.  I have include_once($phpbb_root_path . 'bbantispam.' . $phpEx); in common.php right after &lt;?php 
<br />

<br />
1) However, when logging on I don't always get the spam message.  I have a couple of different user accounts and if I log into one, type anti-spam msg, then log out and login as another profile, it does not ask.  Is that because it doesn't go with username but with cookie?
<br />

<br />
2) If someone types an incorrect username or password when logging in, instead of going to the error message saying you can't log in, it goes to the anti-spam msg first, then back to the error msg.  How can I have them finish logging in correctly before giving them this msg?
<br />

<br />
3) Lastly, I have mChat mod.  When I log on as an the highest permission my admin/ACP username, the spam question shows up in the actual chat message. I know I installed mChat correctly because I did it with the automod and had no problems.  I have screenshots if needed!  I worry that it might log other people on to my board and put the question there as well.

<br />

<br />
thanks for the questions!

<br />
For (1), you've correctly identified the reason: the pass code is in a cookie. And I think that there is no reason to re-ask a question when re-logging.
<br />

<br />
As for (2) and (3), it's all about compromises: a specialized tool vs a generic tool suitable in 99.99% cases. Unfortunately, you have the rest 0.01%. The only solution is to make the tool a bit specialized. In particular, the code of forum should be modified to avoid running bbAntiSpam in some situations. How to do it? Sorry, I can't help with it. But any friend with basic web programming skills could help you.<br />_________________<br />Oleg Parashchenko, bbAntiSpam
