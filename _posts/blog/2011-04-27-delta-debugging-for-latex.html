<p>From the <a href="http://www.st.cs.uni-saarland.de/dd/">delta debugging homepage</a>: "With Delta Debugging, we can find failure-inducing circumstances automaticallyâ€”circumstances such as the program input, changes to the program code, or program executions." I tried to apply this technique to LaTeX, and surprisingly it worked. The code and samples of the experiment are <a href="http://github.com/olpa/tex/tree/86e556822effc63a3fa8630899b2ac47200bdd9a/delta_debugging">uploaded on github</a>.</p>
<p>The tools are:</p>
<p>* diffdelta.py: Finding which diff chunk causes an error.<br />
* latexdd.py: Finding a minimal failing example<br />
* stydd.py: sty-bug hunting</p>
