<p>At some moment, I found that I'm afraid of writing new code. The reason was simple. I wrote in PHP and, obviously, without unit testing. I got the programmer's block as punishment. To overcome the block, I had to create tests first.</p>
<p>As usual, the first thing I made, was searching Usenet. And I'm astomished by the result. The search for "unit testing" in the group "comp.lang.php" generates on four (4!) pages! PHP developers suck!</p>

<p>Well, I switched to usual Google and found few resources:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lastcraft.com/first_test_tutorial.php">PHP unit testing tutorial - Creating an example test case in PHP</a><br />
The first link I got.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.opensourcetesting.org/unit_php.php">PHP unit testing tools (7 found)</a><br />
The complete list of PHP unit testing frameworks.</p>
<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.php/browse_frm/thread/9e1c06f2ea753fc7/6a30edda800ea77d">Unit testing in PHP.</a><br />
Thread in comp.lang.php, with critique of phpunit, PHPUnit and PHPUnit2.</p>
<p>I didn't have time to investigate all the frameworks in the details. Therefore, impressed by the good documentation, I chose <a href="http://www.lastcraft.com/simple_test.php">SimpleTest</a> (don't be misguided by the name, it's actually full-featured).</p>
<p>I've written the tests for my application, and I'm glad with this framework. Thank you, Marcus Baker, for SimpleTest.</p>
