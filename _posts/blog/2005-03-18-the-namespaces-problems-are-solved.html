<p>In the <a href="/blog/2005/03/17/first-attempt-on-namespaces-conversion/">previous entry</a> I wrote about the two faults in the conversion code. Now they are fixed. And the code have became a bit better.</p>
<p>Attributes are now also namespace aware.</p>
<p>I'm afraid of PIs, entities and other similar things be namespace aware. I hope not. Looking at the Namespaces in XML Specification... Well, all is ok. Namespaces are only for elements and attributes.</p>
<p>While coding, I looked into the file "tree.c" from the libxml2. The non-trivial code of "xmlNewProp" and "xmlNewNsProp" are nearly identical, but differ a bit. Going to report to the developers' mailing list.</p>
