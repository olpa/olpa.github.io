					<p>Evil spammers and renegade programmers aren’t who you think they are. Sure, both types of Internet abusers can trace their origins back to random individuals who weren’t commercially organized and whose actions didn’t really cause a huge ripple effect across the ‘Net. But all of that has changed.</p>
<p>Today’s virus attacks are written by professional software developers who charge fees to buyers who want to release their own spam, virus or Trojan horse attack. Developers sell plug-and-play “instant virus outbreaks&#8221; and root kits that can be purchased and downloaded online. Organized crime cartels from around the world have sunk their claws into the Internet and they’re making billions of dollars per year running their spam networks and phishing sites.</p>

I also wrote about why this method of protecting your site from spam wasn’t as good an idea as it seemed from a technical point of view. Today I want to tell you about a few legal issues you may face if you choose to utilize a blacklist.</p>
<p>One of the biggest legal obstacles is that UK webmasters are subject to fines and penalties if they transmit sensitive user data to any organisation that is not subject to the UK Data Protection Act.</p>

					<p>Many people, including me, believe that security by obscurity gives a false sense of security. Any security tool must be available in source code, even to bad guys. But <a href="http://bbantispam.com/atc/">Advanced Textual Confirmation</a> (ATC) is encoded. Why?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all about the business. If I deliver the tool as is, some &#8220;alternatively smart&#8221; programmer can copy/paste the code in a few minutes and start selling the clone. This is my worry: &#8220;alternatively smart&#8221; programmers.</p>

					<p>True Story:</p>
<p>I became so irritated from using phpBB2 Advanced Visual Confirmation, which ended up causing me more trouble that it was worth, that I finally did something about it.</p>
<p>After thinking that I had wrapped a spammer-proof wall of security around my forum, I discovered that spammers were having an easier time decrypting my captcha images than my authorized members were. In fact, I often ended up having to manually register new users who I thought weren’t smart enough to decipher the image that was sitting right there in front of their face. It was only after I tried (and failed) to register one particular user <b>5 times</b> that the truth hit me:</p>
<p>When it comes to default captcha decoding skills: Computers win, humans lose.</p>

					<p>Every now and then a smart anti-SPAM solution comes along that’s actually worth taking a close look at. <a href="http://recaptcha.net/learnmore.html">ReCAPTCHA™</a> is one of those tools.</p>
<p>Everyone who reads my blog already knows that standard CAPTCHA utilities have been hacked. And you already know that the best form-based anti-SPAM tools require a modicum of human intelligence to unlock the comments form and allow a comment to be posted. </p>
<p>And that’s why I’m so excited about ReCAPTCHA. Not only is it human intelligence-based, but it’s free as well. And to make it even better, if you use ReCAPTCHA, you’ll actually be helping to spread literacy around the world.</p>
