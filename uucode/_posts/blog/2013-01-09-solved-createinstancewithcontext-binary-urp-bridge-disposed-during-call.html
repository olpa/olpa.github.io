<p>I decided to experiment with OpenOffice automation from Python, found the official <a href="http://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Python">PyUNO wiki</a>, followed the "a must read" link <a href="http://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/PyUNO_bridge">PyUNO bridge</a> and tried the proposed hello-world program "<tt>hello_world.py</tt>". As it was feared, nothing worked immediately. The error was:</p>
<p><code>
<pre>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "hello.py", line 19, in <module>
    desktop = smgr.createInstanceWithContext( "com.sun.star.frame.Desktop",ctx)
__main__.RuntimeException: Binary URP bridge disposed during call
</module></pre>
<p></code></p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>The search in Internet was not helpful. Instead, it added confusion.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there was a mention of the tool <a href="http://dag.wieers.com/home-made/unoconv/">unoconv</a>, which converts between any document format that OpenOffice understands. I tried it to test if it would fail with the same problem. But it worked perfect.</p>
<p>I opened the source code, found that <tt>unoconv</tt> does a lot of initialization of the environment and decided to reproduce it. I dumped the environment inside the <tt>Convertor::__init__</tt> method:</p>
<p><code>
<pre>
for i in os.environ.iteritems():
  print '%s=%s' % i
</pre>
<p></code></p>
<p>This helped to construct my own initialization:</p>
<pre><code>
export URE_BOOTSTRAP=vnd.sun.star.pathname:/usr/lib/libreoffice/program/fundamentalrc
PATH=/usr/lib/libreoffice/program:$PATH
export UNO_PATH=/usr/lib/libreoffice/program
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/libreoffice/program:/usr/lib/libreoffice/ure/lib
export PYTHONPATH=/usr/lib/libreoffice/program:$PYTHONPATH
</code></pre>
<p>Now "hello_world.py" works as promised.</p>
