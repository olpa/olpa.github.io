				<div class="KonaBody"><p>As the most popular blogging platform, <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> is a target of spammers. If you are an average blogger, your everyday job is to delete spam from you blog, even if you have an anti-spam tool installed.</p>
<p>The default antispam weapon is <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a>. But I dislike it. More rambling follows later, now just google for &#8220;<a href="http://www.google.de/search?q=akismet+sucks">akismet sucks</a>&#8221;.</p>
<p>What I develop, use myself and highly recommend to everyone is &#8230;</p>
<p><span id="more-58"></span></p>
<p>&#8230; is <a href="http://bbantispam.com/atc/">Advanced Textual Confirmation</a> (ATC). It&#8217;s an universal antispam for PHP-scripts, inclusing phpBB2, phpBB3, WordPress and many others.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to compare ATC with tools such as Akismet or Spam Karma. They are from different categories. Follow this funny story:</p>
<blockquote><p>During the space race back in the 1960&#8217;s, NASA was faced with a major problem. The astronaut needed a pen that would write in the vacuum of space. NASA went to work. At a cost of $1.5 million they developed the &#8220;Astronaut Pen&#8221;.  Some of you may remember. It enjoyed minor success on the commercial market.</p>
<p>The Russians were faced with the same dilemma.</p>
<p>They used a pencil.</p></blockquote>
<p>Advanced Textual Confirmation is such a pencil. <a href="http://bbantispam.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=285">Install it now</a>.</p>
