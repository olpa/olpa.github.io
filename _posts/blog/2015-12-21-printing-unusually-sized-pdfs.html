<p>The PDF is of some non-standard landscape layout, the printer is an usual A4 printer, the software can't handle the mix correctly. The solution is to tune the dimensions of the PDF pages manually.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>First, rotate to the portrain orientation:</p>
<p><code>pdftk non-standard-landscape.pdf cat 2-85E output rotated.pdf</code></p>
<p>I wanted only a few pages (from 2 to 85), the rotation flag <tt>E</tt> was choosen by experimenting (there are also <tt>N</tt>, <tt>S</tt> and others).</p>
<p>Second, fit to A4:</p>
<p><code>pdfjam --paper a4 rotated.pdf --outfile a4.pdf</code></p>
<p><tt>pdfjam</tt> has lot of options (through the LaTeX package <tt>pdfpages</tt>), I'm sure an option for rotating is also present, but I was lazy to find it.</p>
