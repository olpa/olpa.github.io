<p>After reading Paul Isambert's article "<a href="https://www.tug.org/members/TUGboat/tb31-3/tb99isambert.pdf">Three things you can do with LuaTeX that would be extremely painful otherwise </a>" I finally decided to check <a href="http://www.luatex.org/">LuaTeX</a>. Unfortunately, the code from the article does not work under old LuaTeX from TeX Live 2009 (and probably from TeX Live 2010 too). I downloaded a binary from the site, tried to run it and got an expected error:</p>
<pre>
This is LuaTeX, Version beta-0.40.6-2009100220 (TeX Live 2009)
(Fatal format file error; I'm stymied)
</pre>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>There is no README. No installation instructions. No FAQ entry. Just a binary file.</p>
<p>Below is my way to run a new luatex without changing the working installation of TeX. First of all, I need the <tt>textool.sh</tt> wrapper to run TeX tools from non-standard locations, <a href="http://uucode.com/blog/2010/04/28/running-tex-tools-from-non-standard-locations/">decribed here</a>.</p>
<p>The next step is to generate a new luatex format:</p>
<pre>
$ ./textool.sh ./luatex --ini luatex-plain.tex
$ mv luatex-plain.fmt luatex.fmt
</pre>
<p>Finally, the file compiles:</p>
<pre>
$ ./textool.sh ./luatex LuaTUGboat.tex
</pre>
<p>As for luatex, context etc, I think the approach is the same. I don't need these formats (yet), therefore haven't tried to find details. They are welcome as comments.</p>
