<p>Recently <a href="http://consodoc.com/">Consodoc</a> has passed refactoring and all the unit and functional tests. Now I've tried it in the real life.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Result is exciting.</p>
<p>I expected that the build process will look better with Consodoc, but I didn't expect how much better. I'll never return to the old GNU make process.</p>
<p>Now it's time to concentrate on documentation and releasing version 1.0.</p>
