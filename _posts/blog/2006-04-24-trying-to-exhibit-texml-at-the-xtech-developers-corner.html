<p>As part of the exhibition at XTech 2006, the organizers are reserving an area in the exhibition space for independent developers to show their work (<a href="http://xtech06.usefulinc.com/2006/04/22-devcorner">via</a>). I've submitted TeXML.<br />
<!--more--></p>
<p>Title: TeXML<br />
URL:   http://getfo.sourceforge.net/texml/<br />
Description: an XML syntax for TeX (LaTeX, ConTeXt).</p>
<p>TeXML is successfully used to publish XML through LaTeX by me and by other developers. I'd like to share experience and outline how TeXML can affect XML publishing.</p>
