<p>I've decided to get money from my sites. No, I don't desperately need money. Actually, what I want to fix is the following. I see that my resources can bring some wealth, but currently they are wasted. Too bad.</p>
<p>The main source of income are</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Google AdSense and SEO links. Less known sources and useful tips can be found in the document "<a href="http://www.johnchow.com/book/make-money-online.pdf">Make Money Online</a> With John Chow dot Com and learn how I went from Zero to over $10,000 a month by blogging." by John Chow.</p>
<p>However, there is a <i>big</i> problem. Without traffic you earn nothing. And organic traffic grows very slow. To stimulate it, you need to advertise.</p>
<p>But how do you know if your advertising works? You need to track and estimate ROI (return of investment). These gory details are explained nowhere. I'm going to reveal them. <a href="http://uucode.com/blog/feed/">Subscribe to RSS</a>.</p>
<p>One of the main tools is the web site statistics. Not that funny diagrams produced by the standard software, but statistics which can be used as a guide to success. It's a topic for the next post.</p>
