<p>Seems interesting: <a href="http://plastex.sourceforge.net/">plasTeX</a> is a LaTeX document processing framework written entirely in Python. It currently comes bundled with an XHTML renderer (including multiple themes), as well as a way to simply dump the document to a generic form of XML. Other renderers can be added as well and are planned for future releases.</p>
