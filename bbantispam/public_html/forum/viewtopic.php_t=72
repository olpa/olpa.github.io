X****r bot is your main enemy. Among other things, he can:
<br />

<br />
    * find the forum on your site,
<br />
    * select the best forum category to post to,
<br />
    * decode many types of CAPTCHA,
<br />
    * pass through javascript protection,
<br />
    * complete email verification,
<br />
    * create accounts on free mail services.
<br />

<br />
Fortunately, X****r is quite expensive and his site isn't translated to English yet.
<br />

<br />
Recommendation: if you write your own protection, expect that spam bots are smart and humans help them.

The demo link and purchasing page gives it reality which your summary can't fully convey. Saying it can decode CAPTCHA isn't as powerful as seeing the most convoluted images get decoded.
<br />

<br />
All in all, it just shows how important textual confirmation is. I can't imagine any other effective way to block spammers than to challenge new users with a question that must be answered logically.

That's a pictocode (ticket, captcha, human verification code).
<br />
In the process of it's work, the X****r program, can succesfully recognize tickets, automatically downloading the picture and decoding it. As practice showed us, it takes 1-1,5 seconds to decode such a ticket, and usually even less than that (on a PC with a CPU 1 Ghz). Such a picture's size is usually not more than 3-5Kb so it's downloading time is less than a second.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">

<br />
X****r automatically recognizes which type of tickets is used and chooses the proper decoding algorythm. All this can be clearly seen in the demo version of the software which you can download on our site, after registration. 
<br />

<br />
You may think that making such a powerful decoder is meaningless - a great lot of forums do not use pictocode. It is not.
<br />
It is the more popular forums, with a higher number of users and visitors, make use of the more powerful protection from robots - among others they use the pictocode. Posting your mesages on these forums gives the best returns!</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">

Yes, this is right off their copyrighted web site (with the obvious exception of the censoring since I don't want to advertise for them).
