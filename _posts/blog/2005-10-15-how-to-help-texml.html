<p>I've got a question:</p>
<blockquote><p>I'm pretty interested in the TeXML project, and would consider helping in the development. Could you tell me how active the project is at the moment, and where you think it is heading / what remains to be done?</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=8587019&forum_id=44318">I answered:</a></p>
<p>The project is active. During the last months I was adding new essential features. Now I'm tuning the code and going to write documentation for TeXML 2.0.  I'm afraid I can't delegate these tasks.</p>
<p>The best help for TeXML is developing TeXML-based solutions. It could be converting DocBook or TEI or OpenOffice or WordML to PDF through TeXML and pdfLaTeX. I recommend to join XML2TeXML project:</p>

<p>The author writes (<a href="http://xml2texml.sourceforge.net/">http://xml2texml.sourceforge.net/</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>Since I don't have much time to spend, I would very much appreciate if you are a developer who knows how to deal with XSLT and wants to join the club of XML2TeXML developers. If you are interested, send me an e-mail.</p></blockquote>
