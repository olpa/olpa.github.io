<p>Sometimes I dump binary data into XML. Being aware of illegal bytes (0-8,B-C,F-1F), I encode everything in base64. But there is a nice alernative way, just <a href="http://lists.xml.org/archives/xml-dev/201210/msg00159.html">revealed by Roger Costello in the xml-dev maillist</a>:</p>
<p>Move any illegal characters into the Private Use Area: for each illegal character add hex E000.</p>
