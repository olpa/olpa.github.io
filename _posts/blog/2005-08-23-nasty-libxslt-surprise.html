<p>Libxslt optimizes "xsl:text", but there is no mention of the optimization neither on the site of libxslt, neither in its mailing list. I've got the knowledge from the deep debugging session. Should I hate libxslt, or should I love it for its puzzles?</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>See what has happened.</p>
<p>A fragment of an XSieve program:</p>
<pre>&lt;x&gt;
  &lt;x:text&gt;[[[&lt;/x:text&gt;
  &lt;s:scheme&gt;&quot;123456789&quot;&lt;/s:scheme&gt;
  &lt;x:text&gt;]]]&lt;/x:text&gt;
&lt;/x&gt;</pre>
<p>Result is as expected:</p>
<pre>&lt;x&gt;[[[123456789]]]&lt;/x&gt;</pre>
<p>Now near the same XSieve fragment:</p>
<pre>&lt;x&gt;
  &lt;x:text&gt;[[[&lt;/x:text&gt;
  &lt;s:scheme&gt;&quot;12345678&quot;&lt;/s:scheme&gt;
  &lt;x:text&gt;]]]&lt;/x:text&gt;
&lt;/x&gt;</pre>
<p>But the result made me crazy:</p>
<pre>&lt;x&gt;[[[]]]&lt;/x&gt;</pre>
<p>Fortunately, gdb helped me. I traced libxslt and found very interesting fields in the XSLT context structure:</p>
<p>* const xmlChar * lasttext : last text node content<br />
* unsigned int lasttsize : last text node size<br />
* unsigned int lasttuse : I don't know</p>
<p>The first "x:text" was creating a text node and setting the last-variables. "s:scheme" was adding a text to the node, but was not updating the variables. (How could I know about it?) The second "x:text" was using data from the variables, therefore result of "s:scheme" was losing. I applied the simplest fix: after executing "s:scheme", I reset "lasttext" to NULL.</p>
<p>I still don't understand why the losing happened only for short strings. Probably it's somehow related to the variable "lastuse". But I don't care.</p>
