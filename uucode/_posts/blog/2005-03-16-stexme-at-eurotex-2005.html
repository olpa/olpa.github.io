<p>It seems sTeXme was mentioned at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.eu.org/eurotex2005/en/157-intro.html">EuroTeX 2005</a>. I've just stumbled upon the <a href="http://www.dante.de/dante/events/eurotex/papers/MOT10.pdf">preprint</a> (PDF) of Jonathan Fine's talk "TeX Forever!". He mentions sTeXme several times, and I'm very pleased with his writing. I couldn't write better! Thanks you, Jonathan.</p>
