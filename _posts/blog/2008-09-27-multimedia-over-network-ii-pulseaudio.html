<p><a href="http://www.pulseaudio.org/">PulseAudio</a> is a sound server. Applications feed music to PulseAudio, and PulseAudio decides what to do with it. For example, it can send the sound over network.</p>
<p>When I tried to use this feature for the first time, I failed. Therefore, I experimented with a more user friendly software (see <a href="http://uucode.com/blog/2008/09/24/multimedia-over-network-i/">multimedia over network I</a>, and the second attempt was successful.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Actually, the second attempt is just a building a minimal working system.</p>
<p>My minimal "<tt>/etc/pulse/default.pa</tt>" looks as the following:</p>
<pre><code>
.nofail

load-module module-native-protocol-unix

load-module module-null-sink sink_name=rtp
load-module module-rtp-send source=rtp.monitor destination=127.0.0.1 port=1234 loop=1
set-default-sink rtp
</code></pre>
<p>Instead of the recommended way to run PulseAudio as "<tt>pulseaudio -D</tt>", I avoid the daemon mode and use the debug mode:</p>
<pre><code>
$ pulseaudio -v
</code></pre>
<p>Streaming audio (without video) to self:</p>
<pre><code>
$ mplayer something.avi -ao pulse -vo null
</code></pre>
<p>To hear:</p>
<pre><code>
$ cvlc rtp://@127.0.0.1:1234
</code></pre>
<p>Again, the second test is to stream to self, but using an external IP. The third test is to stream to another PC.</p>
<p>According to the documentation, the option "destination" is "Destination multicast group for both RTP and SAP packets, defaults to 224.0.0.56". I suspect it means "broadcast address", but I'm not sure. For me, it's enough to stream to just one leisure PC.</p>
