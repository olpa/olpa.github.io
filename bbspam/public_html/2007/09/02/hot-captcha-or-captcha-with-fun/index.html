				<div class="KonaBody"><p>CAPTCHA or not CAPCTHA&#8230; Any anti-spam protection disturbs your visitors. But folks at <a href="http://www.hotcaptcha.com/">HotCaptcha.com</a> found a nice trick to compensate the irritating proof-you-are-a-human step. What they do?</p>
<p><span id="more-29"></span></p>
<p>They display photos of nine girls (or men), and ask to select the three best persons. The main idea is that only a human can distinguish between beauty and ugliness. It&#8217;s the main strength of the approach: bots will never be so smart to analyze people.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, &#8220;beauty vs ugliness&#8221; is also the main problem. See one of theirs CAPTCHAs:</p>
<p><img src='../../../../wp-content/uploads/2007/09/hotcaptcha.jpg' alt='HotCaptcha example' title='HotCaptcha example' width="303" height="302" /></p>
<p>I am a human, but I can&#8217;t select the best faces: everything is equally bad for me. After reloading the page, I get similar disappointing results. And it seems I&#8217;m not alone.</p>
<p>There are also two technical disadvantages of HotCaptcha:</p>
<p>* The approach requires JavaScript. Well, in the modern world 99.999% of the users have JavaScript enabled. But many generations of webmasters, including mine, still dislike relying on JavaScript.</p>
<p>* To validate the user response, the code uses the CAPTCHA identifier and the answers. But I don&#8217;t see any protection against identity theft. One can:<br />
1) manually pass validation,<br />
2) record the ID and answers, and<br />
3) instruct the spam bot to pretend it answered the captcha with this ID.</p>
<p>In this case, the spam bot doesn&#8217;t need to load the page with CAPTCHA at all! Bad, very bad. It&#8217;s a big security hole, and this captcha has to be disqualified.</p>
<p>In any case, I like the idea. And I praise the guys behind HotCapctha for their marketing skills and creativity:</p>
<p>* Very nice idea<br />
* Like me, a lot of bloggers have written about HotCaptcha and given a link<br />
* HotCaptcha drives traffic to a dating site. If you like a girl, you can date her!<br />
* Their CAPTCHA is of the web20-style. I think the photos are taken from the dating site, and &#8220;beauty vs ugliness&#8221; is derived from ratings on that site.</p>
<p>In short, they use CAPTCHA as a promotion tool. Can you do it too? How? Please comment!</p>
