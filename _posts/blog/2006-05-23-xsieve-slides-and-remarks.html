<p>The slides of my XTech 2006 presentation "<a href="http://xtech06.usefulinc.com/schedule/detail/44">XSieve: extending XSLT with the roots of XSLT</a>" are <a href="http://xmlhack.ru/protva/xtech2006-slides.pdf">online as PDF</a>. The paper is available as <a href="http://xtech06.usefulinc.com/schedule/paper/44">HTML</a> and <a href="http://xmlhack.ru/protva/xtech2006-paper.pdf">PDF</a>.</p>
<p>I got a positive feedback after presenting XSieve. But why I'm not blogged? I sure I mentioned something worth noting or discussing. For example:</p>
<p>* If we implement an XML transformation library in some traditional language, we get a poorly re-implemented XPath and XSLT.</p>
<p>* Buzzword candidate "gestalt entity".</p>
<p>* S-expressions and XML are different, incompatible creatures.</p>
<p>* XML virtual machine as Scheme plus SXML.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I'd like to say thanks to <a href="http://eric.van-der-vlist.com/blog">Eric van der Vlist</a>. I borrowed a laptop from him for the presentation.</p>
<p>What I disliked most during XTech, it's absence of printed proceedings. It's a great fault. But probably I'm the only one who needs it.</p>
