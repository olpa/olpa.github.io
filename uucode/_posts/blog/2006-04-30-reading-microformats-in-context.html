<p>I've got a <a href="http://xmlhack.ru/texts/06/microformats/microformats.html">translation</a> of the Uche's article "<a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2006/04/26/microformats-grddl-rdfa-nvdl.html">Microformats in Context</a>".</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>I was very confused after reading, so I printed out the English version and read again. While the message of the article is clear, some places are wtill very hard to read (in particular, the first and the last paragraph).</p>
<p>Probably it's due to the complexity of the topic.</p>
<p>Probaly the article should have been splitten on several smaller articles.</p>
<p>In any case, the article definitely worth reading.</p>
