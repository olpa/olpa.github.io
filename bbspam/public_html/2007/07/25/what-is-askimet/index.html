<p><span id="more-12"></span></p>
<p>Short for Automated Kismet, Askimet is an automated spam killer that’s free as long as it’s for personal use. But if you’re using your blog to make money – which is what the majority of bloggers do – the creators prefer that you pay to use it. Although the cost is nominal it is nonetheless an expense.</p>
<p>The way Askimet works is really pretty simple. After installing this plug-in, Askimet sends every comment, trackback or pingback your blog receives – and those that hundreds of other Askimet users generate – to a central database. Based on a built-in algorithm Askimet then determines whether each entry is spam or whether it is legitimate.</p>
<p>If Askimet thinks it has found spam it saves the comment, trackback or pingback for 15 days in another database that you can access anytime.</p>
<p>Why would you need to access “spam�? that’s sent to this other Askimet database? After all, isn’t the whole point to be rid of it once for good? Well the Askimet algorithm is continuously undergoing a learning process and incorporating new rules as it encounters them. And while in this continual learning stage it sometimes misclassifies something as spam that really isn’t and vice versa.</p>
<p>When you and others retrieve what Askimet users call a “false-positive�? from this database you’re all helping Askimet learn to do its job more effectively by updating its rules guidelines.</p>
<p>Besides WordPress, you can plug Askimet into contact forms, Wikis, and forums. It understands languages other than English, too.</p>
<p>By now you’re probably thinking Askimet is definitely worth installing, right? Not so fast, there&#8217;s a dark side to Askimet that I&#8217;ll reveal in my next post.</p>
