<p>Shame on me. The TeXML processor had a bug in the core functionality.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Consider the following XML:</p>
<pre>
&lt;para>
Paragraph starts ...

... and ends.
&lt;/para>
</pre>
<p>One can try to translate it to TeX this way:</p>
<pre>
Paragraph starts ...

... and ends.
\\pre
</pre>
<p>But this conversion is invalid. In TeX, a blank line creates a paragraph break. In the example above, we have two paragraphs instead of one.</p>
<p>TeXML comments out blank lines to avoid paragraph breaks:</p>
<pre>
Paragraph starts ...
<b>%</b>
... and ends.
\\pre
</pre>
<p>The bug was in understanding what is a blank line. The blank line in TeX is not just the empty line. The blank line is a line which consists of zero or more space characters. Now the bug is fixed.</p>
