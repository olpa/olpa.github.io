<p>Before starting fixing the <a href="/blog/2005/03/21/default-namespaces-force-new-changes/">default namespace problem</a>, I've created a test framework and added several tests. The results are as usual.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>1) I found an error in my code (well, it's just a redundant warning, but anyway it should be fixed).<br />
2) I found that an example in the SXML specification looks wrong (TODO: ask in the mailing list).<br />
3) I found that libxml2 rejects such XML: "<tt>&lt;doc>]]>&lt;/doc></tt>" (TODO: figure out if it is right or not).</p>
<p>The testing framework is trivial. Test code is contained in XSLT-files which are applied to themselves. The code is written in such a way that it generates a lot of elements "<tt>test</tt>" with children "<tt>native</tt>" and "<tt>scheme</tt>". Content of "<tt>native</tt>" is an XML produced by xsltproc, content of "<tt>scheme</tt>" is a result of execution of Scheme code with further conversion to XML. The both contents should be exactly the same. This condition is checked by a Python script.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this approach doesn't allow testing of handling of error conditions. Maybe I'll invent something later.</p>
<p>I added several tests which should cover all the SXML structures except namespaces. Testing of namespaces is a task of the next few days.</p>
