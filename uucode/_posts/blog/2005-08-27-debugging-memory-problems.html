<p>I should feel lucky. I've debugged and fixed program crashes, which were induced by <i>garbage collection</i>. It have taken only 4 days. I've added 5 lines to the program, and 8 problem issues go away, and more issues will be closed after testing.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>The main problem during debug was to identify the source of the bugs. I managed to find the reason on the third day. It was Guile garbage collection.</p>
<p>For those who is using Guile and getting</p>
<pre>freed cell %p; GC missed a reference</pre>
<p>You are lucky to find this note.</p>
<p>If you store Guile values in heap, make sure that the garbage collector can find them. If not, use the function "<tt>scm_gc_protect_object</tt>".</p>
