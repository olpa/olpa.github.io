<p>For long time, I'm thinking about a generative Scheme R5RS implementation. It means that if I need Scheme for a platform XXX, then I take the implementation, adapt a small bootstrap core to the platform XXX, and automatically have got the full Scheme. <a href="http://www.omnigia.com/scheme/cpscm/home/">CPSCM</a> seems fit to this description.</p>
