<p>Update from 10.4 to 10.5 introduced a pain. After sleep and wake up, Mac losts connection to the wireless network. To reconnect, I have to specify SID and the WEP key manually. I hate it.</p>
<p>As a temporary solution, I found how to re-connect from a command line, thanks to the blog article ``<a href="http://osxdaily.com/2007/01/18/airport-the-little-known-command-line-wireless-utility/">airport - the Little Known Command Line Wireless Utility</a>''. I've created the file <tt>reconnect.sh</tt> and run it when required:</p>
<pre>sudo airport -A<i>SID</i> --password='$<i>WEP_key</i>'</pre>
