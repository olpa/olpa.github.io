<p>Yesterday I submitted a feedback on Google AdSense advertisements. (I'm getting verry irrelevant ads!)</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>I was not surprised when I got a confirmation letter that my feedback was received. Good companies send feedbacks, and Google is a good company (at least, at the moment).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the confirmation missed the impotant information. Guess which while reading the quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Thank you for your email regarding Google ads. Your feedback contributes to the growth of our advertising programs as we move forward.</p>
<p>We appreciate you taking the time to write to us. We will respond to any questions you may have as soon as we can.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Here is my answer:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I afraid to be troublesome, but I suggest not only to send confirmation letters, but also include the original feedback message. As for me, I usually can't remember what exactly I wrote.
</p></blockquote>
