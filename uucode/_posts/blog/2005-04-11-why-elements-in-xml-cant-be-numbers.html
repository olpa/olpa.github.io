<p>A man wanted to make the numbers be the tag identifiers. Nope. Not allowed. He asked in the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/xml-doc/">xml-doc mailing list</a> why. <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/xml-doc/message/5203">My answers</a> follows.</p>

<p>Before reading it, <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/xml-doc/message/5199">check the original letter</a>. If ready, let's go.</p>

<p>Let's say I want a numbered list in XML to contain data. The natural thing to do is to make the numbers be the tag identifiers as part of a parent group.

<p>It depends. For me it's very unnatural. Numbers shouldn't be in XML,<br />
they are to be calculated by a visualisation/transformation agent.</p>

<p>(This is a really _simple_ example of my main scenario)</p>
<pre>
< ?xml version="1.0" standalone="yes"?>
&lt;World>
&lt;Widgets>
&lt;Count>15< &lt;Count>
&lt;1>...some data...&lt;/1>
&lt;2>...some data...&lt;/2>
&lt;3>...some data...&lt;/3>
...You get the idea...
&lt;/Widgets>
&lt;/World>

<p>What _was_ the W3C (ir)rationality behind the idea of requiring element names to start with a letter?
</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the design goals for XML was "XML shall be compatible with SGML", and SGML works so.</p>
<p>More, having a programming background, it's quite natural to avoid literals which start with a number. It's because allowing this limits flexibility in different tools.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following XPaths:</p>
<pre>aaa[bbb]
aaa[1]</pre>
<p>The former selects elements "aaa" which have a child "bbb", the latter selects the first element "aaa".</p>
<p>If we allow "1" as an element name, how to interpret the following:</p>
<pre>/World/Widgets[1]</pre>
<p>Is it "Widgets" which have a child "1" or is it the first "Widget"?</p>
