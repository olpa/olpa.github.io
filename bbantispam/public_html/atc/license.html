<p>The license comes in three forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>the free license,</li>
  <li>the standard license, and</li>
  <li>the professional license.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Free license</h2>
<p>You can use Advanced Textual Confirmation (ATC) for free to evaluate it. The free version is not time limited, and contains all functionality, with the following limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can't change the layout of the default question-answer form.</li>
  <li>The default form contains a link to a missed image on your site, therefore your error log is polluted a bit.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Standard license</h2>
<p>Buy the standard license to:</p>
<ul>
<li>change the look and feel of the question-answer form to be consistent with the design of your site,</li>
  <li>sponsor development of the anti-spam tools.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://secure.plimus.com/jsp/buynow.jsp?contractId=1686969">Buy now</a>, because the price is only $29.95!</p>

The recommended payment method is credit card. Alternatives might result in additional fees. European users who want to pay by wire transfer (online banking) without fees, please contact us directly.</p>

<h2>Professional license</h2>
<p>This is for web developers who would like to customize</p>
<ul>
<li>not only the look and feel, but also the functionality of Advanced Textual Confirmation</li>
</ul>
<p>to tailor it to the customer's site. Instead of starting from scratch by writing a clone of Advanced Textual Confirmation, you can get the documented source code of ATC itself.</p>
