<p>After upgrading my Linux, I've got sound lost. Everything looked ok -- all the modules are loaded, all the special devices are created, no complaints in logs, -- but no sound.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Everything looked like the sound was muted (switched off).</p>
<p>Finally, the solution in found: in "alsamixer", the base of the bars "Master" and "Front" (and probably of some others) should contains the letters "<tt>OO</tt>" instead of the letters "<tt>MM</tt>". From the man-page:</p>
<blockquote><p>When a mixer control is turned off, M (mute) appears below  the  volume  bar.   When it's turned on, O in green appears instead.  You can toggle   the switch via m key.</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem is easy when you know the solution.</p>
