Then today my wife phones up &quot;did you send me a message?&quot; No ... and it turns out that all the users except the admins has been send the pleading Nigerian scam private message.
<br />

<br />
Unfortunately, there's no option to restrict private posts on my version, so as privatemessaging isn't an important feature I had to disable it.
<br />

<br />
The really annoying thing was that I could not find an ip address because the user had not posted so I cannot restrict the IP address in future.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">And worst of all I sent out my own email to the spammers by mistake (I forgot to delete them before sending the mass email)</span>
<br />

<br />
Personally these people should have a pile built of all the scrumpled emails they send out and then have them tied to a stake a few feet off the ground and then asked &quot;do you regret sending so much spam&quot;.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
