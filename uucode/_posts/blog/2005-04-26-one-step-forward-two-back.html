<p>Conversion of the attribute nodes seems working, although with some glitches. And I traditionally mention namespaces. I decided to have holes in ns processing in the first version.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>By the way, what's surprised me most is that in SXML it's possible to store a namespace declaration together with an attribute. Consider the following XML:</p>
<pre>&lt;a b:c="d" xmlns:b="u.w.z" /></pre>
<p>If we take an attribite, we get:</p>
<pre>b:c="d"</pre>
<p>loosing information about the "b" prefix. Compare it with SXML where we can carry the attribute together with the namespace:</p>
<pre>(@ (b "c") (*NAMESPACES* (b "u.w.z")))</pre>
