<p>I've submitted an application for participation in the <a href="http://wiki.di.uminho.pt/wiki/bin/view/GTTSE/WebHome">Summer School on Generative and Transformational Techniques in Software Engineering</a>.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>I'd like also to give a presentation about my ongoing work.</p>
<p>Tentative title:  Using DSLs on top of Scheme VM</p>
<p>Tentative abstract:</p>
<p>The idea of using the Scheme programming language itself as a native virtual ma<br />
chine language is advocated.</p>
<p>Any sufficiently good Scheme implementation becomes a Scheme VM implementation. The VMs supposed to be embedded into host applications. Due to a number of Scheme implementations, Scheme programs, and consequently DSLs on top of Scheme, can be reused in a number of host applications on different programming platforms.</p>
<p>We discuss different issues of the embedding, one of which is lazy mapping of data between the host and Scheme. We share practical experience of using Guile Scheme implementation in C programs.</p>
<p>As for programming in Scheme, we highlight such features as macros, compilation to source code and using a sort of AOP.</p>
<p>The running example of domain-specific language is XPath.</p>
