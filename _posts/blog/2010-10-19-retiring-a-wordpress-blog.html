<p>I wanted to retire a <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>-based site, converting everything to static HTML. My first idea was to mirror the site with wget (or any other web downloader), but I decided to search if a better solution was available. Not found, but instead a ready wget recipe was found: <a href="http://www.suodatin.com/fathom/How-to-retire-a-wordpress-blog-(make-wordpress-a-static-site)">How to retire a Wordpress blog (make Wordpress a static site)</a>. My addition:</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>1) Instead of the command line</p>
<pre><code>$ wget -r -E -T 2 -np -R xmlrpc.php,trackback -k http://[BLOG URL]</code></pre>
<p>I used a version with more flags:</p>
<pre><code>$ wget -r -E -T 2 -np -R xmlrpc.php,trackback -k
  -p --wait=5 -o log http://[BLOG URL]</code></pre>
<p>* <b>-p</b>: get all images, etc. needed to display HTML page.<br />
* <b>--wait=SECONDS</b>: wait SECONDS between retrievals<br />
* <b>-o</b>: log messages to FILE.</p>
<p>2) WordPress creates URLs from the titles of the posts. It leads to non-ASCII symbols in the addresses and (in my case) errors due to multiplce conversion-reconversion to-from unicode. To find such posts (after mirroring):</p>
<pre>$ find . -type f |  grep %</pre>
<p>I had only a few bad posts and fixed the problem manually, visiting the control panel, managing the posts, changing the "Post Slug". Then re-mirrored the pages.Probably a better, automatic solution exists.</p>
