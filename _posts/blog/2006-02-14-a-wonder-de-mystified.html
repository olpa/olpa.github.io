<p>There is rumour that sometimes people start to speak in a foreign language, even if they have never learnt or heard it. That could be assigned to the overworld mind. But I think the things are simplier.</p>
<p>Today I visited a German hospital. Unexpectedly, I alone had to entertain a 7-month German baby. So I recited Russian poetry for 2 hours. A seed for new wonder has been sowed.</p>
