<p>Due to a long period of inactivity in TeXML project, I've just been asked if the project is still supported. The answer is <b>yes</b>!</p>
<p>I use TeXML in production, it's an important part of our new publishing process.</p>
<p>Why the project is inactive? Because no bugs are reported for the version 2.0.1, released on 19 July 2006 (today is 10 April 2008). If it works well, why bother to change anything?</p>
