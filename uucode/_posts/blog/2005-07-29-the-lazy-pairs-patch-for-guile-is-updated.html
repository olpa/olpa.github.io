<p><a href="http://uucode.com/texts/lazypair/index.html">Lazy pairs patch for Guile</a> allows to implicitly instantiate parts of S-expressions on demand. Today I've refactored the distribution archive.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>The old distribution was a set of files (by the way, the set was not full) plus instructions which files to modify manually. That was not very smart. Now I suggest three alternatives:</p>
<p>* a full Guile distribution with patches applied<br />
* a set of files which are changed or new<br />
* a file for <tt>patch</tt></p>
<p>There is also a package with examples. All the files are hosted now at SourceFrge as a part of the XSieve project.</p>
