<p>I'm writing a paper for a conference. It should be written with conformance to the <a href="http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/index.html">Lecture Notes in Computer Science</a> style. After visiting the page with <a href="http://www.springeronline.com/sgw/cda/frontpage/0,11855,5-164-2-72376-0,00.html">information for LNCS authors</a>) I though that it might be a sort of magic for many people.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Springer encourages authors to use LaTeX2e, provides a style file for LaTeX, documentation and samples. The samples and instructions are quite good to start writing a paper immediately if</p>
<ul>
<li>you know LaTeX, and</li>
<li>the <tt>llncs</tt> style is installed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Springer can't help with the first issue. But it isn't important.</p>
<p>The problem is that they don't provide (or I haven't found) help on installing the style. The number of people that can do it is much smaller of those who know LaTeX.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I'm one from that small group. Here is my way to use the style locally without putting it into the core LaTeX directories.</p>
<p>The style files are stored in the file <tt>llncs2e.zip</tt>. I unpacked them into the folder "<tt>~/univer/gpce05/springer/texmf/tex/latex/llncs2e</tt>". In fact, the path before "<tt>texmf</tt>" is not important.</p>
<p>First of all, I decided to check the sample file <tt>llncs.dem</tt>. As dvi-file already exists, I generated pdf:</p>
<pre>
$ pdflatex llncs.dem
$ pdflatex llncs.dem
</pre>
<p>The command was given twice to get correct links. On the first run, the database of links is created, and on the next runs the database is used.</p>
<p>Now goes local installation of the style. I'm not going to comment it. Consider it as magic:</p>
<pre>
$ export TEXMFLOCAL=~/univer/gpce05/springer/texmf
$ texconfig rehash
$ file ~/univer/gpce05/springer/texmf/ls-R
</pre>
<p>The first command specifies location of the local TeX repository. The second commands indexes the repository, and the last one just makes sure that the index is created.</p>
<p>To check, use the sample from the file <tt>typeinst.zip</tt>. Let me demonstrate a failure first. Open a new window and try to compile the TeX-file:</p>
<pre>
$ latex typeinst.tex
</pre>
<p>You get an error like:</p>
<pre>
LaTeX Error: File `llncs.cls' not found.
</pre>
<p>The right way is to specify the location of the repository first:</p>
<pre>
$ export TEXMFLOCAL=~/univer/gpce05/springer/texmf
$ latex typeinst.tex
$ latex typeinst.tex
</pre>
<p>Again, I'm running LaTeX twice to get correct links.</p>
<h2>1 October 2005, update</h2>
<p>There is an easier way. Just copy "llncs.cls" to the same folder were your LaTeX file is located.</p>
