<p>The problem is best described by <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex/browse_frm/thread/b3cf90ca11e15e66/b86b5a8096c5f727#b86b5a8096c5f727">someone else's question</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I'm trying to use the generic list environment inside a longtable. Unfortunately I get unexpected space above and below the list environment. If I use the same list between normal paragraphs, this extra space is not there.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p></blockquote>

<p>Recently a similar question <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex/browse_thread/thread/fedbf3afc4a36577/20a3198cee905dac#20a3198cee905dac">was asked</a> in comp.tex.tex, and <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex/browse_frm/thread/fedbf3afc4a36577/f15955f6fd583614#f15955f6fd583614">I answered</a>.</p>
<p>Probably the "res" package uses some tabular environment. It seems that unneeded vertical space before and after a list in a cell is a known problem without a good solution. In your case, instead of hardcoding sizes, I'd try something like this (probably, with \null):</p>
<pre>
\\vspace{-\\baselineskip}\\vspace{-\\parskip}\\vspace{-\\parsep}
</pre>
<p>I don't know why \topset doesn't work. I suspect that that table cell starts in the horizontal mode, and when a list adds a break penalty, TeX creates an empty paragraph due to switching from the horizontal mode to the vertical mode.</p>
<p>By the way, for my longtables I use the following commands:</p>
<pre>
\\newcommand{\\celltolist}{\\vspace{-\\baselineskip}\\vspace{-\\parskip}}
\\newcommand{\\listtocell}{\\vspace{-\\baselineskip}\\vspace{-\\parskip}\\vspace{-\\parskip}}
</pre>
<p>Probably it's only a coincide that these commands work for me.</p>
