<p>Paul Tremblay has published an article for XML authors who want to use open source software to produce high quality PDF documents. He suggests using ConTeXt, a variation of TeX, and advocates using TeXML for conversion of XML to ConTeXt:</p>
<p><a href="http://contextgarden.net/Getting_Started_with_XML_and_ConTeXt">http://contextgarden.net/Getting_Started_with_XML_and_ConTeXt</a></p>
<p>And I've added some comments on the article:</p>
<p><a href="http://contextgarden.net/Talk:Getting_Started_with_XML_and_ConTeXt">http://contextgarden.net/Talk:Getting_Started_with_XML_and_ConTeXt</a></p>
<p>I'm happy to see that TeXML becomes popular, and not only because I'm the author, but also because I really believe in the benefits of TeXML.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I released TeXML 1.23 development version with ConTeXt support. Unfortunately, documentation is not updated yet.</p>
