After technical posts, Michal shares non-technical notes on the opposite of EEG, namely using electical signals to affect brain activity.

This device is a voltmeter. [Prof. Dr. Berger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Berger) called the voltmeter an [electroencephalogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography). Long words in German are common, so he took the word electric and the word encephalus (brain in Latin) and the word gram (short name for a diagram). By connecting these 3 words, Prof. Dr. Berger invented a complicated name for a voltmeter that's designed for measuring the brain voltage and showing it as a diagram where the voltage fluctuates.

He also used the opposite of EEG, electric stimulation to alter the brain activity. He worked on synthetic telepathy (transferring brain signal through a wire from one subject to another subject, so that he measured voltages of one dog and electrically stimulated another dog with voltages from the first one. He succeeded. He was able to trigger certain behaviors in the 2nd dog that exactly copied the 1st dog.). Other researchers continued and tried it on monkeys, etc.

I found there is also [EMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_muscle_stimulation). Basically, when you send some particular voltage to a location in your elbow, for example, your arm closes. And when you send a different specific voltage to that location, your arm opens. So, it's possible to control your own, or anybody elses, movements via EMG.  Some location has the nerve. And the nerve conducts electricity that you can measure with EEG sensors. When you use electric stimulation, it can be simply a wire or an EEG electrode that you attach to your arm, near the nerve, and then you send some small voltage that you previously measured from it while you were opening your arm, or closing your arm.

This way, if you were lazy and didn't want to do i.e. abdominal crunch exercises, you'd be able to fit yourself with electrodes and after sensing voltages from a real exercise, you'd be sending voltages there to make yourself exercise automatically.

And this is part of what I'm investigating. Someone has been abusing a more advanced technology that's wireless. It's ahead of the publicly known state of the art by several decades. And most people never heard of it, and unless they witness it themselves they won't believe it exists. If you read about [Prof. Dr. Berger's story when he fell from a horse](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hans-berger-telepathy-neuroscience-brain-eeg), you will find he witnessed it. And that's what made him work on EEG to prove synthetic telepathy is possible. And he proved it. He read via EEG from one subject and stimulated another subject with the first subject's thoughts. The wireless BCI that doesn't require any physical contact with the body is futuristic and unknown. One explanation is that it's a <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_project> that was researched and developed in a locked R&D lab by some clandestine unit of the military that does espionage, sabotages and assassinations with a plausible deniability. Whoever witnesses this working from a distance ends up like Prof. Dr. Berger without any evidence and it takes many years to prove at least a bit more than is already publicly known. The clandestine unit had to employ teams of professional scientists for many decades, throughout WW1 and later, in order to have such tools and weapons for black ops. It's like a nuclear bomb, but for the brain. Unlike a nuclear bomb, I don't think this will get declassified.

In 1994, one computer scientists whom I knew personally, has estimated the technology was 5 decades ahead, back then. Now it's 2025 and it still appears to be, in ChatGPT's estimate still at least 50 years ahead of today. So, I'm afraid nobody publicly worked on it over the last 31 years at all. I'd like to distinguish between publicly known science, such as published breakthroughts, and private/unknown science that includes unpublished breakthroughs exploited for an asymmetric warfare.
