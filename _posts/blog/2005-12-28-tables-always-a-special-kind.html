<p>I though I need several minutes to write a FrameMaker script. Script had to change font size in a block of text. What could be simplier? Unfortunately, global apply doesn't work: text in tables isn't affected. The only solution I found is to walk over all table cells and re-apply new properties. I dislike the solution, but it at least work.</p>
