<p>For my XTech paper, I need an example of usage of XSieve in practice. So, I finally have written a code which was in the mind for two months (more on it later, it worths a separate post). As I started to make a redistributable package, I got a problem.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>An XSieve stylesheet starts with</p>
<pre>
&lt;s:init>
(load "my-library.scm")
&lt;/s:init>
</pre>
<p>What happens if you install this stylesheet somewhere in <tt>/usr/share/...</tt> and use from the home directory? Right, <tt>load</tt> doesn't find <tt>my-library.scm</tt>, and the stylesheet fails.</p>
<p>Very frustrating.</p>
<p>Workaround through the environment variable <tt>GUILE_LOAD_PATH</tt> is possible, but I don't like it.</p>
<p>Finally, I've updated XSieve a bit. Now XSieve automatically adds directories with XSieve stylesheets to the Guile load path. And instead of <tt>load</tt>, stylesheets should use <tt>load-from-path</tt>:</p>
<pre>
&lt;s:init>
(load-from-path "my-library.scm")
&lt;/s:init>
</pre>
<p>At the moment, this feature is in CVS only, but I think I'll release a new version in the near future.</p>
