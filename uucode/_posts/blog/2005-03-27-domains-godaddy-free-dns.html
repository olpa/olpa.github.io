<p>Now I'm the owner of the quite good domains "tohtml.com" and "2html.com". I'm surprised why they were free.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>I have some ideas what to do with these domains, but I'm not sure that I'll find a time to implement the ideas. In ant case, domain names were so good that I purchased them. </p>
<p>I used <a href="http://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy.com</a> to register the domains. The process was simple, the only problem was to avoid additional paid services.</p>
<p>Before paying, I decided to google for a promo code. There was a lot of them, but the most popular one is "CANDY". I used it and saved 1$ per domain, 2$ total. Not much, but still pleasant.</p>
<p>Today I noticed that GoDaddy created a cybersquatter-like advertisement site on my domain names. I do understand why they did it, but dislike such approach.</p>
<p>At first, I though of throwing away some DNS records, but then decided to redirect them to the IP of one of my sites. The only problem was that at the moment I din't want to pay for DNS services.</p>
<p>Googling for "free DNS" gives a lot of link. I stopped on "<a href="http://soa.granitecanyon.com/">Granite Canyon Group</a>". In technical things, I trust "Best Viewed With Any Browser" sites more than super-designed sites. It seems I created zone records incorrect, but I'll fix it later.</p>
