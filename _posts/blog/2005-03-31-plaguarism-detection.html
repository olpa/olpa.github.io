<p>I developed a tool named <a href="http://getreuse.com/">GetReuse</a> that smartly calculates a similarity percentage of two texts. At the moment the project is dead, but sometimes I advertise it a bit.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Recently I found a <a href="http://rentacoder.com/RentACoder/misc/BidRequests/ShowBidRequest.asp?lngBidRequestId=262957">request at rentacoder</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I need a VB.NET implementation of three widely used 'text/pattern' matching algorithms used for detecting plagiarism of English text.</p></blockquote>
<p>Poster mentioned the following algorightms:</p>
<ul>
<li>YAP3 Algorithm</li>
<li>Winnowing</li>
<li>MDR Algorithm</li>
<li>Moss</li>
<li>JPlag</li>
</ul>
<p>I was not able to hesitate writing a comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
<p>You wrote:</p>
<p>"I do not want theusual simple text matching algorithm or file differentiating algorithm"</p>
<p>I have a solution named "GetReuse". It's based on scientific research and is one of the most accurate methods.</p>
<p>I'm not going to persuide you to buy GetReuse or use my services (unfortunately, I'm out of business for several months), but you definitely should know about it.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>Oleg Paraschenko
</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, I don't need a reply, but I'd like to get it.</p>
