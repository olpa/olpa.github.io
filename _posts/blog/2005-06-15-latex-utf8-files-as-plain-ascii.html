<p>I have problems with non-latin publishing through LaTeX, and I'm going to ask for help in forums. While asking, I should provide a sample LaTeX file, but how to show non-latin characters? Fortunately, I have TeX background and know some tricks. One of them is that combination "^^xx" is interpreted as a character with the hexadecimal code "xx" by the TeX reader before any other processing. So, for example, if I use the symbol "\u9009" which is encoded in utf8 by bytes "e9", "80" and "89", I can write in the source LaTeX file: "^^e9^^80^^89".</p>
