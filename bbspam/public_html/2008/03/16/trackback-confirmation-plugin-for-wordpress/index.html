				<div class="KonaBody"><p>Finally, I&#8217;ve released yet another but unique anti-spam plugin for WordPress. The formal description:</p>
<blockquote><p>Publishing of a trackback or a pingback is postponed till someone, usually a trackback author, approves it. Trackbacks which are not approved in 20 hours are automatically deleted. It stops spam from bots and allows trackbacks from the real humans.</p></blockquote>
<p>A better description is probably a description by an use case:</p>
<p>* Alice has Trackback Confirmation installed.<br />
* Bob has written a blog post with a link to Alice&#8217;s blog post.<br />
* Bob checks if a trackback appears in the Alice&#8217;s blog.<br />
* No, the trackback hasn&#8217;t appeared. But Bob notices the link &#8220;approve trackbacks&#8221;.<br />
* He follows the links, finds his trackback and approves it.<br />
* Now Alice&#8217;s blog links to the Bob&#8217;s post.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just a web 2.0 style of trackback moderation. Comments are approved not by the blog&#8217;s author, but by the blog&#8217;s visitors.</p>
<p><span id="more-64"></span></p>
<p>If you like the idea, <a href="http://bbantispam.com/wp/trackback/TrackbackConfirmation.zip">download the plugin Trackback Confirmation</a>. How to install:</p>
<p>* Unpack the file &#8220;<code>tbconf.php</code>&#8221; and put it into the folder &#8220;<code>wp-plugins</code>&#8221;.<br />
* Activate the plugin (the admin area, the pane &#8220;Plugins&#8221;).<br />
* Create a page (the admin area, the pane &#8220;Manage&#8221;, the subpane &#8220;Pages&#8221;). This page will be used as a template page for Trackback Confirmation.<br />
* Configure the plugin (the admin area, the pane &#8220;Plugins&#8221;, the subpabe &#8220;Trackback Confirmation&#8221;).<br />
* Now you can assign the status &#8220;private&#8221; to the template page, if you want.</p>
<h3>Warning</h3>
<p>The code is unmaintained. I don&#8217;t provide any support. If you have any questions, please ask them in the WordPress support forum.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>My blogs are not popular, and are very rarely linked. Therefore, further improvement of the script isn&#8217;t profitable. Meanwhile, I got a better idea how to fight the trackback spam (see &#8220;<a href="http://uucode.com/blog/2008/01/15/decline-and-fall-of-the-trackbacks-rise-and-resurrection-of-the-trackbacks/">decline and fall of the trackbacks; rise and resurrection of the trackbacks</a>&#8221;). As result, I simply disabled trackbacks and deactivated the plugin. Obviously, I don&#8217;t have any incentive to support it.</p>
<p>But the code is written and works well. I hope someone can take over the code and continue development. Here is the short TODO list:</p>
<p>* If there are no trackbacks: do not print an empty table, but say something.<br />
* On the moderation page, add a link to the post from a comment.<br />
* Make sure that HTML is escaped on the template page.<br />
* Make sure that there are no SQL injections (shouldn&#8217;t be possible, but it&#8217;s better to audit).<br />
* Notifications should be sent not using PHP function &#8220;<code>mail</code>&#8221;, but using WordPress function &#8220;<code>wp_notify_postmaster</code>&#8221;.<br />
* Instead of using SQL to change the trackback status, the code should use something like &#8220;<code>wp_set_comment_status(ID,'approve')</code>&#8221;.<br />
* Add some design.<br />
* Submit Trackback Confirmation to WordPress plugin repository.</p>
