<p>My old interest is to influece the brain to make it working more efficient.</p>
<p>One of the approaches is to learn complete relaxation, or in other word meditation. The book "<a href="http://www.amazon.de/dp/3426300702/">Meditation f√ºr Skeptiker</a>" by Ulrich Ott suggests a scientific evidence for this claim, and I decided to try.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>I tried and failed. I wasn't able to understand if I was doing the process right or not. I wanted to have some tool which would say if the brain activity slows down or not. I searched for something like "eeg for home" but there were no such thing, and usual eeg-devices were very costly.</p>
<p>Recently I found the project <a href="http://openeeg.sourceforge.net/doc/">OpenEEG</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The OpenEEG project is about making plans and software for do-it-yourself EEG devices available for free (as in GPL). It is aimed toward amateurs who would like to experiment with EEG.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then I found an already built OpenEEG-based device from <a href="https://www.olimex.com/">Olimex</a> (Europa/Bulgaria). The total cost of everything what required was around 150 euro, the internet-feedback about the firm and theirs electronics was good. So I've ordered it:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.olimex.com/Products/EEG/OpenEEG/EEG-SMT/">EEG-SMT</a><br />
Low cost open source EEG device, completely assembled, USB interface<br />
<a href="https://www.olimex.com/Products/EEG/OpenEEG/EEG-SMT/"><br />

</a></p>
<p>Also required:</p>
<p>* 4 active electrodes, <a href="https://www.olimex.com/Products/EEG/Electrodes/EEG-AE/">EEG-AE</a><br />
* 1 passive electrode, <a href="https://www.olimex.com/Products/EEG/Electrodes/EEG-PE/">EEG-PE</a><br />
* <a href="https://www.olimex.com/Products/Components/Cables/USB-A-B-CABLE/">USB-A-B-CABLE</a></p>
<p>I got the package in several days. Everything was good packed.</p>
<p>The only problem is to find which one is the passive electrode. All the 5 look the same. I decided that the passive should be simplier, and found exaclty one without some (amplifier?) chip. Don't forget to mark the electrode to find it again easily.</p>
