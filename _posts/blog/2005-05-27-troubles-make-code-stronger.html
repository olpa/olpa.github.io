<p>A small test case revealed weak points in my code. Fixing each point was making the code worse and worse. Fortunately, I got insight. Why not to use a fake node? I did it, and code became simpler, hundred lines smaller, and I automatically fixed a weak point for which I had had no idea for a workaround.</p>
