<p>While communicating about making TeXML distribution archives, I've got examples of powerful use of "setup.py".</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Using "setup.py" is a standard Pythonic way to install Python packages. Here is a bit of documentation: "<a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-distutils.html">distutils -- Building and installing Python modules</a>".</p>
<p>And the new knowledge I've got is the commands</p>
<pre>python setup.py bdist_rpm
python setup.py sdist --formats zip,gztar</pre>
<p>The former command should create a RPM archive, and the latter -- zip and tar.gz archives.</p>
<p>I think there are more powerful uses of "setup.py".</p>
<p>But at the moment I have a problem. Copying files to archives is not enough. I need also some modifications made on the fly. Hope it is possible.</p>
