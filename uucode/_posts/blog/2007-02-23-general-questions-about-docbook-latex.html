<p>In the mailing list docbook-apps, I recently <a href="http://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/docbook-apps/200702/msg00171.html">answered</a> to the post titled "<a href="http://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/docbook-apps/200702/msg00158.html">General questions about DocBook -> LaTeX</a>". I think my notes are interesting not only for the subscribers, but also for others.</p>

<blockquote><p>
I've read online that some people follow a different procedure; instead of going from DocBook to FO, they go from DocBook to LaTeX before creating their final PDF print output (using dblatex<http ://dblatex.sourceforge.net/>, for example).  I am wondering if this would be a better publishing model for my needs, since I know LaTeX is made for print output.  I've never used LaTeX before, however, so it would take some research on my part before starting to work with it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Unless you are an experienced LaTeX user, you'd better avoid the LaTeX way.</p>
<blockquote><p>
So, the point of this email is to ask some general questions, if anyone with more experience can answer them for me:</p>
<p>1. What are the main advantages of going from DocBook to LaTeX before generating final print output of documents?
</p></blockquote>
<p>The main advantages:</p>
<p>* better typesetting quality,<br />
* more control over the final layout.</p>
<p>However, if you don't know LaTeX, you can't get them. An offensive remark: I expect that the authors of dblatex and db2latex are not LaTeX experts and their tools don't give the advatanges.</p>
<p>I'm also not an expert, but I have experience with converting XML to LaTex. I lost a lot of time in LaTeX debris, but the results were very good.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, at the moment the results are not available. Year ago, I promised to write DocBook TeXML stylesheets, but I still can't start doing it.</p>
<blockquote><p>
2. If you know what you're doing, can you do most things with XSL stylesheets and FO that you could do with LaTeX?<br />
3. Which publishing model would be the best choice for making pretty PDFs for print.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I've developed Consodoc publishing server:</p>
<p>XML to beautiful documents<br />
http://consodoc.com/</p>
<p>I think it's one of the best choices.</p>
<blockquote><p>
I realize that these are vague questions, and it is probably perfectly valid to respond "it depends on what you are actually doing in your documents".  I understand this, but I wanted to first get a basic understanding of what can be gained by the DocBook -> LaTeX publishing model before further investing large amounts of time in either approach.
</p></blockquote>
<p>At the moment, the safe side is to follow FO. At least, nobody will accuse you in case of problems.</p>
