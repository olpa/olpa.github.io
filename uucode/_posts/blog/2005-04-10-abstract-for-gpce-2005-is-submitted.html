<p>I'm slowly and painfully writing a paper for the <a href="http://gpce.org/05/">Generative Programming and Component Engineering</a> (GPCE'05) conference. I hate my writing which should be thrown away and rewritten from scratch. But deadline is near, and today was a firm day for submitting abstracts.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>So I've submitted my abstract:</p>
<p>Reusing XML processing code in non-XML applications</p>
<p>XML can be considered as a representation of hierarchical data, and the XML-related standards&nbsp;&mdash; as methods of processing such data. We describe benefits of XML view on legacy data and its processing, and suggest a method to develop XML tools and make them reusable for different tree-like structures in different programming languages.</p>
<p>Our approach is to use virtual machine technology, in particular, the Scheme programming language. We're taking the unusual step of using the Scheme syntax itself as a native virtual machine language. Together with the SXML format and Scheme implementations tuning, it gives us the XML virtual machine.</p>
<p>Reference implementations are ready for the Python and C languages. We describe a library for XSLT-like transformations of the Python parse trees and a special version of the GNU find utility which supports XPath queries over the file system.</p>
