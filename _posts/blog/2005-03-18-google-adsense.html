<p>I've decided to join the <a href="http://www.google.com/adsense/"> Google AdSense</a> program. Now you can see advertisement blocks at the sidebar. Hope they are relevant, and that it may give me revenue.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>The changes were quite trivial. In the folder "<tt>./wp-content/themes/default</tt>" I created the file "<tt>adsense.php</tt>" and in the file "<tt>sidebar.php</tt>" I added near the end:</p>
<p><code>&lt;?php include (TEMPLATEPATH . '/adsense.php'); ?></code></p>
<p>It is enough to show ad blocks on all pages with a sidebar. A personal page for a post doesn't have a sidebar, so I also changed the template "<tt>single.php</tt>".</p>
