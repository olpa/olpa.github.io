    <h1>Stopping bbspam mail</h1>
    <h2>What happens</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You have installed <a href="http://bbantispam.com/tc/">Textual Confirmation</a> for phpBB2</li>
      <li>You use the free community version of this tool</li>
      <li>Each time a spam registration is blocked, this version sends a notification to you and to the community database</li>
      <li>As phpBB2 is retired, the community database is also retired and switched off</li>
      <li>Your server can't send the report and notifies you about it</li>
      <li>You think that the emails are sent from bbspam.com</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Who blame?</h2>
    <p>Ok, me. I should have planned the end of the product live in advance.</p>
    <h2>What to do?</h2>
    <p>Sorry, but <i>I</i> can do nothing. The mails are sent by a tool installed on <i>your</i> server using <i>your</i> mail server, without any connection to bbspam.com.</p>
    <p>What can you do:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Uninstall or disable Textual Confirmation</li>
      <li>Upgrade from the community edition to the business edition ($30)</li>
      <li>If you know PHP, edit the code and disable emailing functionality</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Final words</h2>
    <p>Textual Confirmation was one of the best antispam tools for phpBB2, its revised version <a href="http://bbantispam.com/atc/">Advanced Textual Confirmation</a> is still one of the best antispams for PHP sites. Together, they saved a lot of time for the site owners. <a href="http://bbantispam.com/feedback.html">Read testimonials.</a></p>
