<p>Due to historical reasons, my Linux box at work uses Promise RAID. Recently (month ago) I added a new HDD (AFAIK, attached to ICH5). Unfortunately, the HDD didn't work.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>The first attempt was to try to find anything in "/dev/hd*" and in "/dev/sd*". No success.</p>
<p>The second attempt was more serious. I even looked at manuals and searched information in Internet. No success.</p>
<p>I have a lot of important projects, so I can't spend much time on technic and system administration. Also, I had a lot of projects in which I didn't need a lot of space. So I gave up trying to mount the HDD.</p>
<p>But soon I'll get a lot of data, so I had to solve the problem. Unexpectely, I've mounted the HDD quite fast. The commands are:</p>
<pre>
# modprobe libata
# insmod /lib/modules/2.4.25-std-up-alt1/kernel/drivers/scsi/ata_piix.o
# mount /dev/sdb1 /x
</pre>
<p>I don't know why it works. Also, at the moment, I don't know how to execute them during boot. However, I have the light in the dark, and I can use room of the HDD.</p>
<p>Now comes final remarks, just for reference. My Linux is <a href="http://altlinux.com/">ALT Linux</a> 2.4:</p>
<p>Linux xxxxxxxx 2.4.25-std-up-alt1 #1 Sun Feb 29 20:06:30 MSK 2004 i686 unknown unknown GNU/Linux</p>
<p>The query phrase for search in Internet is "third IDE master".</p>
