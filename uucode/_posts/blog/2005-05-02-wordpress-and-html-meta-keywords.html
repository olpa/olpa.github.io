<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, the current blogging system I use, doesn't support keywords for pages. Although search engines now don't believe in them, I still like to have them. Finally, I found the way. It's <a href="http://vapourtrails.ca/wp-keywords">Jerome's Keywords Plugin</a> which can do a lot.</p>
