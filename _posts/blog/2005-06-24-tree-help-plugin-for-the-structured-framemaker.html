<p>Sometimes I write texts for the Structured FrameMaker, sometimes I solve problems and support solutions for this program. My productivity is increased after I wrote <a href="http://datahansa.com/th/?blog">Tree Help plugin</a>.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>The plugin adds new actions to the Structure View window. New functionality:</p>
<p>* collapsing the whole tree,<br />
* expanding the whole tree,<br />
* expanding the tree to the insertion point.</p>
<p>Now I don't understand how I worked with structured documents without these functions!</p>
<p>I hope this plugin is useful not only for me, so I release it as a shareware product. It is a beta, I should proofread texts before making worldwide announce.</p>
