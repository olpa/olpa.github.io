<p>Recently I was asked for high-level details of my scientific work. As result, I've written a short text, which I like.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<blockquote><p>The main operations with the tree data in programs are:</p>
<p>* (a) navigation over the trees,<br />
* (b) transformation of the trees.</p>
<p>My work consist of:</p>
<p>* I claim that instead of writing code for (a) and (b) manually, it's more profitable to use XPath and XSLT, correspondingly.<br />
* I explain how to do it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Copied it to my <a href="http://xmlhack.ru/protva/xquery/">research wiki</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, two competitors have appeared recently:</p>
<p>* <a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/treebind/">TreeBind</a> by Eric van der Vlist, and<br />
* <a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/virtualxml">Virtual XML Garden</a> by IBM alphaWorks.</p>
<p>Eric visits <a href="http://xtech-conference.org/">XTech 2006</a>, so I hope we will productively share our experience.</p>
