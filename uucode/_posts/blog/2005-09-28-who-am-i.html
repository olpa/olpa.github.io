<p>I've prepared a mini-bio for a possible DDJ article:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Oleg Paraschenko is a PhD student in the Saint-Petersburg State University, Russia, and a freelance developer in the area of technical documentation. His main research interests are XML technologies and generative programming. In spare time he supports xmlhack.ru, a server for Russian-speaking XML community.
