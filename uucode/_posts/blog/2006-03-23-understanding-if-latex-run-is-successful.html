<p>I'm using LaTeX in batch scripts, and I need to detect if the result is successful. It seems the best way is to look into the log file. I wonder if an imaginery tool "<tt>texloginfo</tt>" exists to:</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>"<tt>texloginfo --rerun</tt>": detect if re-run of LaTeX is required (for example, to get cross-references right).<br />
"<tt>texloginfo --warnings</tt>": extract warning messages from the log file.<br />
"<tt>texloginfo --errors</tt>": extract warning messages from the log file.</p>
<p>I suspect such a program doesn't exist, and I have to write it. Then, if you are interested in the tool, please send me comments and suggestions.</p>
