<p>I've spent two days understanding how to create CJK bookmarks using LaTeX. Finally, I checked the internal structure of a PDF document with a sheet of paper, a calculator and the PDF reference. The PDF document is correct. Problem is in Acrobat Reader 5 (AR5). It is said that AR5 uses the system font to display the bookmarks, and the system font on Windows 2000 Rus doesn't have CJK symbols.</p>
