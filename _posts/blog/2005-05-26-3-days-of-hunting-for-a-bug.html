<p>I've spent 3 days on getting simple code to work. In exchange I've got more experience with xsltproc internals. But I'm not sure it's a fair trade.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>The task was simple. I wanted to apply templates to node in a certain mode. I found that <tt>xsltTransformContext</tt> contains mode and mode uri strings. I initialized these fields with my values, and ... got nothing.</p>
<p>During the first day I was understanding why. The answer is simple. In some cases, xsltproc doesn't use xmlStrCmp to compare string. Instead, xsltproc compares strings as pointers. Pointers comparation works because all XSLT-related strings are interned into one dictionary. One string in the dictionary is used for all strings with the same content.</p>
<p>Second day was lost on making lookups to dictionary. Instead of results I was getting core dumps.</p>
<p>On the third day I wrote a separated code to test only modes. It worked. So I returned to the step two to look more closely at the core dump problem.</p>
<p>And soon I was blaming myself.</p>
<p>I was using "<tt>ctxt->inst->doc->dict</tt>", but <tt>ctxt</tt> was initializing only 20 lines below. Shame on me. Don't work late in evenings.</p>
