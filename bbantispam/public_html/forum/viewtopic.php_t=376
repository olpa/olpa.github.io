I have a group of people who are planning to collaborate on the forum, but the spammers are making everyone uncomfortable and keeping me busy. Textual Confirmation is a great idea and I'm looking forward to using it.
<br />

<br />
The 3-minute mod has taken many hours. Fortunately I was able to find a friend who could guide me through creating that SQL table.
<br />

<br />
The big problem I'm having is that the registration form has completely vanished.
<br />

<br />
I think that is the only problem. It looks as if the new Admin menu is working, and the rest of the phpBB2 site seems okay.
<br />

<br />
I suspect that I'm having the same problem as eyeless in this thread.
<br />

<br />
Since you asked eyeless to send you the attached files I tried to do that, but the email was returned.
<br />

<br />
The zipped record of those 3 files is here: <a href="http://www.ballantyne.com/for_Oleg_Parashchenko.zip" target="_blank">http://www.ballantyne.com/for_Oleg_Parashchenko.zip</a>
<br />
That is a temporary location and I will remove them when the problem is solved.
<br />

<br />
I am also using a MAC, and the text editor is textWrangler.
<br />

<br />
BTW, if you have a problem seeing the forum it could be because I've already banned lots of IPs in Saint-Petersburg. If this is the case, let me know yours and I'll un-ban it.
<br />

<br />
The forum is here: governing.ca/phpBB2/index.php There are 4 hidden forums and 1 hidden usergroup that are not visible.
<br />

Many thanks... Robert</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

<br />
Pain? Having to clean out the spammer accounts at my forum was painful. Tonight it looks as if your MOD has ended all of that. I am truly grateful to you for providing a solution to a huge problem. 
<br />

<br />
I am writing to let you know that with the files you sent, the forum is working well. I have done a run-through of the whole registration process. I can see that your MOD is an elegant solution to a large problem for all of us who want to take advantage of these forums.
<br />

<br />
So, <span style="font-weight: bold">many thanks</span> for taking the time to help out a 'normal' person! 
<br />

<br />
I think that all of us are going to have to learn how to operate in the guts of our software. I run 2 websites, 3 blogs (one is for an association), and now one forum. My wife has just been asked to manage a small non-profit's Joomla site plus a wiki. Big companies can hire pros to do it for them. Us normal people are going to have to figure it out for ourselves.
<br />

<br />
BTW, something earlier in the thread suggested that the problem I was having might be related to using a Macintosh. Since this is likely not the last MOD I will want to use, can you suggest what I was doing wrong?

I sent it to olepar at gmail.com. I think I found the address in one of the forum posts, but I don't remember where. Also, I did not keep the bounced email. Since I have my own domain, spammers often pretend that their emails come from my domain. It means that I can have hundreds of bounced emails in my inbox overnight. I delete them at the POP server. So, I peek at what is there, and that is how I saw that the email I sent to you was returned. But it was deleted.
<br />

In the text files, the end of line is encoded differently on Windows, Unix and Mac. PhpBB templates fail when they are in the Mac format. Therefore, when editing and saving phpBB files, check the options of the text editor: file format should be DOS/Windows or Unix.
