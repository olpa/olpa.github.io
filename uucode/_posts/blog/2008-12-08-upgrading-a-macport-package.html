<p>Upgrading a macports (darwinports) package is not as easy as<br />
<code>
<pre>$ sudo port upgrade something</pre>
<p></code><br />
In many cases I need the following command:</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p><code>
<pre>$ sudo port -u -n -f upgrade something</pre>
<p></code></p>
<p>(Use it only when you know what it means!)</p>
<p>1) <b>-u</b>: The upgrade option by default does not uninstall an upgraded port, it deactivates it. If you wish to uninstall the old version, use the -u<br />
option.</p>
<p>2) <b>-n</b>: If you wish not to upgrade a port's dependencies, use the -n switch.</p>
<p>3) <b>-f</b>: The uninstall phase is a part of upgrade. If a port as installed as a dependency of another port, uninstall will not remove it unless you remove the dependent ports first. To override this behavior, use the -f (force) switch.</p>
