<p>I always used vim (for example, "Ctrl-K" ":" "u" for "Ã¼"), but now I found a way to input such characters into any application, using the core feature of X11/xorg. The explanation and the table are here: "<a href="http://andrew.triumf.ca/iso8859-1-compose.html">ISO-8859-1 compose keystrokes in Linux</a>" (thanks Andrew Daviel).</p>
<p>Reminder for myself: on my system, it's enough to add "compose:ralt" to the option "XkbOptions" in "xorg.conf" and use "Alt Gr" key.</p>
