				<div class="KonaBody"><p>The blog is alive for four month, it contains a significant number of posts. Till recently, all the posts were under the category &#8220;Uncategorized&#8221;. It was ok for a new blog, but it&#8217;s bad for a growing blog. Therefore, I spent significant efforts (more about it in my personal blog: &#8220;<a href="http://uucode.com/blog/2007/09/26/invent-categories-and-tags-easily/">invent categories and tags easily</a>&#8220;) and assigned the topics to each posts. So far the categories are:</p>
<p><span id="more-38"></span></p>
<p>* <a href="../../../../category/articles/index.html">Articles</a><br />
* <a href="../../../../category/bbantispam/index.html">bbAntiSpam</a><br />
* <a href="../../../../category/captcha/index.html">CAPTCHAs</a><br />
* <a href="../../../../category/defeat/index.html">Defeating protection</a><br />
* <a href="../../../../category/explain/index.html">Explanations</a><br />
* <a href="../../../../category/funny/index.html">Funny</a><br />
* <a href="../../../../category/ideas/index.html">Ideas</a><br />
* <a href="../../../../category/phpbb/index.html">phpBB</a><br />
* <a href="../../../../category/services/index.html">Services</a><br />
* <a href="../../../../category/tools/index.html">Tools</a><br />
* <a href="../../../../category/usability/index.html">Usability</a></p>
<p>With this post, a new category will appear, &#8220;<a href="../../../../category/administrative/index.html">Administrative</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>Tagging the posts was a good exercise. I made a fresh look at the blog. And what striked me?</p>
<p>The blog is too official, maybe even boring. The blog looks like a product of a BBC or CNN department. It&#8217;s too bad.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to:</p>
<p>1) limit the editorial posts to only one per week<br />
2) invite other experts<br />
3) reveal the background behind bbAntiSpam tools<br />
4) publish photos, photos, photos</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&#8217;ve added a new feature. Not all people know what is RSS feed and how to read it. Such people can now subscribe for updates by e-mail. The form is on the main page in the right top corner.</p>
<p>What else needs to be added? Please suggest!</p>
