<br />

<br />
I'd like to congratulate to your good work. It seems, that the textual confirmation does its job and prevents spam-registrations. I hope, this would still be the case if once the tool would become very popular.
<br />

<br />
However, here is a suggestion for further development: Use the textual confirmation to update on-the-fly the .htaccess file. For example, log the IPs of the spammers and if there were more than X register attempts that failed from one IP within the last Y days, then add a deny entry to the .htaccess file.
<br />

<br />
I have already modified your &quot;tc_bad_answer&quot;-function such that it would log the IP together with a timestamp in a file. By the way, no panic, I haven't commented out or deleted anything...
<br />

<br />
Are the community spam notifications available for us - the community? Any statistics? Would be interesting to know some numbers/stats.
<br />

<br />
Best regards
<br />

Thanks a lot! And yes, I think that Textual Confirmation (TC) would be even more effective if become popular. Sometimes, if a spam bot fails to register, then a human spam-registers manually. But if TC is installed on many boards, the human will become tired very soon and will just skip such boards.

Thanks for suggesting. Most likely, something like it will be in the future versions.

Unfortunately, at the moment the numbers are unknown, even for me. I need time to work on it. But earlier or later, It will be have done.</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>

I guess it helps (among other things) to have a non-english forum. <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> It may be a long, long while before any human spammer decides to pay me a visit and make a list of my 6-7 answers. And even then, all I have to do is come up with a fresh list, which is easy as pie, because I want everyone to be able to register so it's enough to write some common-sense questions quickly.

Great mod! *thumbs up*</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
