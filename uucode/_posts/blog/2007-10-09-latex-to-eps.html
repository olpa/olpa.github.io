<p>I'm a bit furious. I spent a lot of time on getting EPS from LaTeX. Portability of PostScript and PDF is a great myth. This idea works only in theory. But in practice, one has to struggle with buggy software.</p>
<p>Finally, I've found a working sequence of conversion commands.</p>

<pre><code>
cp latex/312nn081.tex tmp/312nn081.tex

cd tmp; latex 312nn081.tex

dvips -E -o tmp/312nn081.eps tmp/312nn081.dvi

pstoedit -f ps -dt tmp/312nn081.eps tmp/312nn081.ps

ps2epsi tmp/312nn081.ps tmp/312nn081_2.eps

../pictures_converter/bin/epstosmth --gsdev=tifflzw \
       tmp/312nn081.eps --outfile=tmp/312nn081.tif

epstool --add-user-preview tmp/312nn081.tif tmp/312nn081_2.eps \
       eps/312nn081.eps
</code></pre>
<p>I already wrote about "epstosmth": <a href="http://uucode.com/blog/2005/09/29/eps-to-something/">http://uucode.com/blog/2005/09/29/eps-to-something/</a></p>
<p>The main feature of EPS files produced this way:</p>
<p>Both Adobe Illustrator and Adobe FrameMaker open the EPS files without complaints.</p>
