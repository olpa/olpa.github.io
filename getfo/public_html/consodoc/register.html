  <h2>1. Free software dual license</h2>

<h2>2. Per-project licensing</h2>

<p>For each project, you should purchase a project-bound Consodoc license. The output from the Software contains invisible marks, which allow us to identify the license details.</p>

<p>The term “Project” isn't formally defined. Instead, common sense and the fair use approach are applied. Here are a few examples that indicate you have different projects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>different teams,</li>
  <li>different managers,</li>
  <li>the accounts department handles the projects as different.</li>
</ul>

<p>We charge for the new versions of the Software. However, the upgrade fee is only 50% of the difference between the price of the new version and the price of your version.</p>



<h2>4. Custom development</h2>

<p>You are allowed to modify Consodoc source code for your needs, and allowed to distribute and sell the modifications, if you meet all of these conditions.</p>

  <li>Each recepient must purchase a Consodoc licenses in advance.</li>
</ul>



<h2>5. Support</h2>
