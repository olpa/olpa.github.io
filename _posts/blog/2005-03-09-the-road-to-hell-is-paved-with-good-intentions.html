<p>I've spent the evening investigating why I was getting a core dump. It was not an easy task because the code was in a plugin (so it was hard to set a breakpoint) and the data structures were full of links (libxml) or the mess (Guile).</p>
<p>Well, suppose you have the empty element node <tt>par</tt> and two text nodes <tt>node1</tt> and <tt>node2</tt> with the content <tt>text1</tt> and <tt>text1</tt>. You adds nodes <tt>node1</tt> and <tt>node2</tt> as children to the node <tt>par</tt>. What the structure do you get? A node with two text children? No, it's too boring. Excerpt from the <tt>xmlAddChild</tt> description:</p>
<blockquote><p>Add a new node to @parent, at the end of the child (or property) list merging adjacent TEXT nodes (in which case @cur is freed)</p></blockquote>
<p>It was my problem. I was reusing a freed node. It was a big problem because I had to reuse it, and the automatical merging broke the mapping between SCM values and xml nodes. Well, the solution is trivial: I don't map text nodes anymore, and now I see that it is the right way.</p>
<p>Conclusion: sometimes even the road to hell is useful.</p>
<p>By the way, I've implemented conversion of Scheme lists to XML nodesets. The problem above arose while working on the conversion.</p>
