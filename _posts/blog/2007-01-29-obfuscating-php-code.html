<p>Recently I needed to obfuscate PHP code. Nothing fancy, no bullet-proof protection needed. The goals were:<br />
* complicate removing of license protection by an unexpierenced person, and<br />
* prevent code re-use by a third party.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Few options a found in Google (in no specific order):</p>
<p>* <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/phrozen/">Phrozen - PHP encoder</a><br />
* <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/iddin/">iddin - The PHP-Obfuscator</a><br />
* <a href="http://www.semdesigns.com/Products/Obfuscators/PHPObfuscator.html">Thicket(tm) Obfuscator for PHP</a><br />
* <a href="http://sls.web.psi.ch/goto.php/duo/obfuscate.php">Online PHP obfuscator</a><br />
* <a href="http://www.raizlabs.com/software/phpobfuscator/">Encode and Obfuscate PHP Scripts</a><br />
* <a href="http://pobs.mywalhalla.net/">POBS</a></p>
<p>The first thing I was able to run was POBS, therefore I continued with it.</p>
<p>I love open source. Having sources, one can tune a tool. In my case, I needed that an obfuscator were able to run from command line. I played a bit with POBS and got success.</p>
<p>Thanks, Mark and Frank, for POBS!</p>
