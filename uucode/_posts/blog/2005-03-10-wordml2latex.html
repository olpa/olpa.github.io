<p>New software was recently announced in comp.text.tex:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>WordML2LaTeX</b> is a meeting point between two titans in word processing: Microsoft Word 2003 and LaTeX2e. It is a XSL stylesheet that transforms a Word document (WordML) in a LaTeX2e source. With it You can use Word as a front end for LaTeX.</p></blockquote>
<p>It converts XML to LaTeX and it doesn't use <b>TeXML</b>! Very pity. I've written a letter to the author:</p>
<blockquote>

Subj: WordML2LaTeX with TeXML?
</pre>
<p>Hello Ruggero,</p>
<p>I've noticed an announce of WordML2LaTeX in comp.text.tex and looked at it. I can't check how it works as I have no WordML documents. Anyway, the stylesheet looks impressive and interesting for me.</p>
<p>I noticed that you create TeX markup directly from XSLT. This is the reason why I'm writing to you: I'd like to advocate TeXML:</p>
<p><a href="http://getfo.sourceforge.net/texml/">http://getfo.sourceforge.net/texml/</a></p>
<p>It was created specialy for XML to TeX translation, and I totally satisfied with it. I'm not alone. For example, see:</p>
<p><a href="http://contextgarden.net/Getting_Started_with_XML_and_ConTeXt_using_TEXML">http://contextgarden.net/Getting_Started_with_XML_and_ConTeXt_using_TEXML</a></p>
<p>So I'd like to convince you of the using TeXML in the next version of WordML2LaTeX.</p>
<p>Regards, Oleg

<p>By the way, the stylesheet looks good and covers many formatting issues. The software is available on CTAN in the folder "/support/WordML2LaTeX/" (for example, <a href="http://dante.ctan.org/CTAN/support/WordML2LaTeX/">here</a>).</p>
