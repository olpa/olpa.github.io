<p>In order to find if I can affect a program through environment variables, I decided to trace all <tt>getenv</tt> calls and see if there is something interesting. Easy to said, harder to make. Fortunately, it is possible.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Quite fast, I found that I want to use the tool <tt>dtrace</tt>. To my disappointment, I realized that I could not just click and run this tool, but had to learn.</p>
<p>Therefore, at the first I skipped the document <a href="http://dlc.sun.com/osol/docs/content/DTRCUG/gcgkk.html">Tracing User Processes</a> and returned to it only after making all the exercises of a tutorial: <a href="http://wikis.sun.com/display/DTrace/Introduction">Introduction</a>. Finally, I managed to get what I want:</p>
<pre><code>
$ cat getenv.d 
pid$target:libSystem.B.dylib:getenv:entry
{
    printf("getenv: '%s'", copyinstr(arg0));
}
% sudo dtrace -s getenv.d -c my_program
</code></pre>
<p>Note 1: Under Mac OS X, libc seems to be libSystem.B.dylib</p>
<p>Note 2: According to the documentation, I could use <tt>args[]</tt> array. But for some reason, I could not. Instead, I cast the first argument (int) to a string.</p>
