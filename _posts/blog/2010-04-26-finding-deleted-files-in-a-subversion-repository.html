<p>I needed file which was deleted some time ago. Thanks to Subversion, the task is easy as long as you remember the name of the file. Unfortunately, it wasn't a case. Fortunately, I found a magic spell. In the directory where the file was located, say: <tt>svn log --verbose</tt>, and the output will contain all the names and the revisions.</p>
