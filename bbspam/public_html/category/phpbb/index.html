					<p>True Story:</p>
<p>I became so irritated from using phpBB2 Advanced Visual Confirmation, which ended up causing me more trouble that it was worth, that I finally did something about it.</p>
<p>After thinking that I had wrapped a spammer-proof wall of security around my forum, I discovered that spammers were having an easier time decrypting my captcha images than my authorized members were. In fact, I often ended up having to manually register new users who I thought weren’t smart enough to decipher the image that was sitting right there in front of their face. It was only after I tried (and failed) to register one particular user <b>5 times</b> that the truth hit me:</p>
<p>When it comes to default captcha decoding skills: Computers win, humans lose.</p>

					<p>While poking around the Internet I came across this article about <a href="http://www.apromotionguide.com/stopping_phpbb_spam.html">ways to stop PHPBB spam</a>. In it the author talks about 2 tools he believes everyone running a phpBB board needs. What’s nice about the article is that it isn’t a cleverly disguised plug for these products. Instead it’s an independent review so you can be sure these products really work. </p>

					<p>Geez, where do I begin? Spam&#8230;it&#8217;s all about spam. Why can&#8217;t we all live in a wonderful e-world, filled with blogs, picture streams, and wonderful myspaces&#8230; without the hassle of spam. I guess it&#8217;s just like anything else, it&#8217;s subject to users <em>and</em> abusers. Hustlers I call &#8216;em; Skid Row-ers I call &#8216;em.  Plain &#8216;ole scum of the Earth. What are we going to do? They are clever, very very clever&#8230; Well of course!&#8211; We must fight the fires with even clever-<em>er</em>(?) <img src='../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> methods. CAPTCHA was a god-send. That&#8217;s one way. The boys over at bbantispam have come up with a simple yet effective way to wade through the masses of complex, yet somewhat feeble in circumstances, spam bots. Why boys, can&#8217;t you even say &#8220;hello&#8221;? I love it. Keep it coming bbantispam&#8230;&#8217;cause I&#8217;m ready to say &#8220;goodbye&#8221;. If you don&#8217;t know, they have even come up with an effective link rejector. They themselves said it best&#8230; what do spammers register everywhere for?.. duh! to post links.. The links rejector will phase through their links of garbage.</p>
<p>So why am I here? I&#8217;m certainly not here to compete. The folks at bbantispam certainly have a legitimate and effective  product on their hands. I&#8217;m here to introduce, rather humbly, a little project of mine.</p>
<p>Introducing Forum Spammer List, or FSpamlist for short.  This, in a nutshell, is an online database full of known spammer&#8217;s email addresses, popular domains, usernames, and IP addresses that are all easily exportable so that forum administrators can import them into their forum&#8217;s ban lists.  With your help, this database can grow and stay current to aid in forum administrators everywhere to stop known spammers from even registering. Well, how can you help you might ask? This online database can be updated by anyone, anywhere. Well what about false-positives, JACK! Well, that&#8217;s when you&#8217;ve got to trust me&#8230; I&#8217;ve set-up a few security measures to keep the spammers out and the legitimates in. See a name in the database that looks like it shouldn&#8217;t be there?&#8230;just flag it using the link in the spammer profile page and the volunteer team and I will take a look it.</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;ve said a lot&#8230; I&#8217;ve just pulled a shameless plug haven&#8217;t I? I wouldn&#8217;t like to think so.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve come all this way to make a proposal to the folks at bbantispam. I, myself, have installed the Textual Confirmation tool on my forum. It works quite well might I add, and I noticed in the Readme (and in your bbantispam&#8217;s forum) that in the free version of the Textual Confirmation tool actually sends back the spammer&#8217;s data to bbantispam that gets the confirmation prompt wrong. I am proposing that on future feedback reports, that information would also be sent to FSpamlist for holding, and my team and I will look at the data and decide whether it is valid and should therefore be inserted into the database. Why would you do this for us? Well, I thought we are here to stop spam any way we can. <em>But</em>, I do understand the logic of barter, or partnerships if you would. This would be the first partnership of its kind. What I am offering you is complete and utter credit for all data sent to FSpamlist. Those exact terms are open to discussion.</p>
<p>Well, there I&#8217;ve said it.. I&#8217;m just one fishhook in a sea of spammers.</p>

					<p>I&#8217;ve just got a complaint from an user who purchased Textual Confirmation (TC). To his dissatisfaction, TC haven&#8217;t stopped spam. Investigations revealed that he gets spam in guest postings, which is outside of the scope of TC. To stop such spam, he actually needs <a href="http://bbantispam.com/atc/"><i>Advanced</i> Textual Confirmation</a>. The following is what I&#8217;ve answered.</p>
