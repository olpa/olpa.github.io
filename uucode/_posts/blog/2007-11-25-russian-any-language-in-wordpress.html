<p>I tried to setup a new wordpress blog. To my unpleasant surprise, I got a problem with cyrillic letters. They just didn't work, being displayed as junk or as question marks. I spent some time to find out how to correctly setup WordPress for the utf8 environment. Actually, it's very easy:</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>The Mysql database should be created this way:</p>
<pre><code>CREATE DATABASE <i>name</i> CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;</code></pre>
<p>The file <tt>wp-config.php</tt> should contain:</p>
<pre><code>define('DB_CHARSET','utf8');</code></pre>
<p>In case of troubles, the database must be revised first. Check the UTF8 options and texts using phpMyAdmin.</p>
