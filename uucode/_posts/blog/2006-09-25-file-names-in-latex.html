<p>The symbols like "_" and "&lt;SPACE>" are special for LaTeX, therefore using them for file names used by LaTeX isn't a good idea. Anyway, we can't control environment and a solution is required. A bookmark for me: <a href="http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2006-September/006998.html">Passing Underscore</a>.</p>
