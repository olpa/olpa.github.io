<p>I want to analyze an open source application by reading its source code. I don't like reading from the screen. Instead, I'd like to print the code and read offline.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>The application is based on a framework, and therefore consists of a lot of small files. It's not reasonable to print file per page. Instead, it's better to print everything at once. Here is my approach.</p>
<p>First, I visit directories with the source code and issue commands like these:</p>
<pre><code>
for i in *rb; do colorer -h -dc  -igrayscale $i >$i.html; done
for i in *rhtml; do colorer -h -dc -t asp -igrayscale $i >$i.html; done
</code></pre>
<p>The commands above produce HTML files with syntax highlighting. Now I want to join the files to one file and separate chunks by headings. The corresponding command is:</p>
<pre><code>
find . -name '*.html' | xargs -I _ x.sh _
</code></pre>
<p>where <tt>x.sh</tt> is a helper file:</p>
<pre><code>
#!/bin/sh

echo '&lt;h4>' $1 '&lt;/h4>' >>s.html
cat $1 >>s.html
</code></pre>
<p>The rest is simple. Open <tt>s.html</tt> in browser, copy/paste text to OpenOffice, massage the text for printing, and finally print.</p>
