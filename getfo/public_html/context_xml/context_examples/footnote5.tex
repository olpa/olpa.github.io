When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived
alone, in the woods, a mile from any neighbor, in a house which I had
built myself, or the shore of Walden Pond, in Concord, Massachusetts,
and earned my living by the labor of my hands only. I lived there two
years and two months. At present I am a sojourner in civilized life
again.

Thoreau started writing {\sl Walden} in 1846, a few
months after he started living at Walden Pond. He moved back to
Concord late in 1847. By that point he had drafted half of the
manuscript. He continued to work on it for several years.
