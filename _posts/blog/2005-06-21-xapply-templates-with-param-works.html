<p>Finally, "with-param" in the Scheme function "x:apply-templates" works. It took some time because I forget an experience with making "mode" working. Again, parameter name should be in the dictionary. Unfortunately, namespaced parameters doesn't work, probably due to a bug of libxslt. <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=308441">Reported</a>, waiting.</p>
