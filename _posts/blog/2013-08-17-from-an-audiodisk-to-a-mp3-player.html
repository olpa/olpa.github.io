<p>My sequence to grab audiobooks from a cd to hear later on a mp3 player. Grab as mp3:</p>
<pre><code>abcde -o mp3</code></pre>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>The program makes the job perfectly.</p>
<p>But the mp3 player (Samsa Clip+, I like it) is not much smart, or I don't read manuals carefully. When I return to the folder with an audiobook, the player can't remember which track to play. And I neither.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the position inside an mp3 file is saved, and the player suggests to resume play. Therefore, on the step2 I make one big mp3 from tracks.</p>
<pre><code>mp3wrap file.mp3 tracks_folder/*3</code></pre>
<p>The last finement is to update mp3 tags, which are filled by controlinformation for mp3wrap and which I don't need.</p>
<pre><code>
id3tag -Atitle -stitle file.mp3
or
id3tag -Atitle -stitle -tX -TY file.mp3
</code></pre>
