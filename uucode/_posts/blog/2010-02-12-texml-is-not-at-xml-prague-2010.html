<p>To my great surprise, TeXML presentation was not accepted for <a href="http://www.xmlprague.cz/2010/index.html">XML Prague 2010</a>. It's so unexpected, that I'm even not upset, only puzzled. TeXML is one of a few projects which are somehow revolutionary. Seems it's my fault I didn't make it clear. The abstract, the reviews and conclusions follow.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>TeXML: XML to PDF through LaTeX</p>
<p>TeXML is an approach to XML to PDF conversion, an alternative to the XSLT/FO way. The characteristic features are:</p>
<p>* LaTeX is used as a typesetting engine.<br />
* XML logical markup is converted to LaTeX logical markup.<br />
* The low-level formatting details are hidden in LaTeX style files, not in conversion scripts.<br />
* XML to LaTeX conversion scripts are straightforward thanks to an intermediate XML-based language.<br />
* Generated LaTeX code is human-friendly and ready for modification.</p>
<p>To be a real alternative to the established standard, TeXML needs unique competitive advantages. The main are:</p>
<p>* Poor quality auto-layout artifacts in generated PDFs can be fixed by editing LaTeX code.<br />
* Separation of work is encouraged: programmers do programming, and typesetting specialists do layout definition.<br />
* The process is based on open-source tools.</p>
<p>The paper is written from the XML perspective. Only basic knowledge of LaTeX is assumed. TeXML is compared with alternative TeX-based XML-to-PDF projects. Practical experience of using TeXML in production is given. Problems and listed together with the solutions. An appendix provides an example of a simple publishing project, with step-by-step instructions how to convert XML to PDF using TeXML approach.</p>
<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p><b>Neutral</b></p>
<p>I think that TeXML is not new project and given it's non-mainstream technology I don't think that XML Prague is right venue for having presentation about it.</p>
<p><b>Reject</b></p>
<p>There's nothing new in this paper that hasn't been said in the last 10 years. Furthermore there is no paper attached.</p>
<p><b>Strong Reject</b></p>
<p>lacks enough detail to make a positive decision</p>
<p><b>Reject</b></p>
<p>Not matching this year's topics.</p>
<p><b>Reject</b></p>
<p>The paper presents a tool for generating PDF output from XML via an XML representation of LaTeX called TeXML, which seems to be a useful light-weight approach for producing high-quality output in the kinds of applications where TeX excels. This topic, however, is a bit distant from the conference focus for this year.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>My habit of sending an abstract only and writing the paper later has failed here: 2 rejects of 5 reviews. As of not matching this year's topics, usually it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>For me, it seems the failure is due to a bit of unluck. Being of non-mainstream (thanks to the first reviewer for pointing it to me), I get reviewers who a bit distant from publishing XML on paper and don't see any use for TeXML. Contrary, the real users of TeXML are excited with it, and I believe the users more than reviewers.</p>
<p>TODO:</p>
<p>Re-write the abstract and paper so that even reviewers not in topic understand that something important happens.</p>
<p>Finally release the working DocBook stylesheets to be less non-mainstream.</p>
<p>Rework the site, add more new documentation.</p>
