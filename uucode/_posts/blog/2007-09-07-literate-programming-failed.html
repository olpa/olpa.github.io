<p>Those who<br />
* know what is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate programming</a>,<br />
* the ideas and the technical implementation behind it, and<br />
* think this metodology does<b>n't</b> work,<br />
can find this fragment funny (<a href="http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=dtx">Documented LaTeX sources (.dtx files)</a>, emphasis by me):<br />
<!--more--></p>
<blockquote><p>
Another useful way of generating .dtx files is to write the documentation and the code <i>separately</i>, and then to combine them using the makedtx system. This technique has particular value in that the documentation file can be used separately to generate HTML output; it is often quite difficult to make LaTeX to HTML conversion tools deal with .dtx files, since they use an unusual class file.
