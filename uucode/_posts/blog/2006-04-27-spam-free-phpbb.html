<p>I'm an owner of a small phpBB forum. Some time ago I was so tired of spam, that spent some time looking for a solution. I didn't find anything I like, so I've developed the solution myself:</p>
<p><a href="http://bbantispam.com/">bbAntiSpam</a></p>
<p>I highly recommend it to everyone. Installation is less than 1 minute.</p>
