				<div class="KonaBody"><p><a href="../../12/the-best-defense-is-a-good-offense-or-is-it/index.html">Last week I wrote</a> about the “Spamper&#8221; phpbb MOD that used SPAM posts against the spammer. As I mentioned, the idea died because too many people thought that it amounted to a Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDOS). No one wanted the legal liability that could result from what I believed was a great idea.</p>
<p>Well, I got to thinking… Maybe Spamper was a bad implementation of a good idea. So, I took the idea one step further. What do you think of this?</p>
<p><span id="more-33"></span></p>
<p>Instead of capturing the spammer’s URL and directing traffic to it, suppose you modified your comment script so it directed the spammer to a page that you could make some money from?</p>
<p>You use any of the tricks of the trade to recognize a SPAM post. Then you have a routine that does a redirect to a page that you have the potential to earn some money from.</p>
<p>Maybe you send the spamme’s to your Amazon.com affiliate link and try to sell them a copy of the Harry Potter book. Or maybe you pop up a banner ad that sells one of your product or services.</p>
<p>You could even simply do a redirect to one of your pages that you need traffic to so you can build your Alexa rankings! Wouldn’t it be great if spammers helped you reach a Top 500 rating? Heck, you’d almost want to seek them out and thank them for their troubles.</p>
<p>Think about it. Now, instead of cringing every time a new spammer shows up, you start hearing “Ka-ching!&#8221;</p>
<p>When life hands you lemons, make lemonade!</p>
<p>So what are your ideas? If you could make a few shekels from every spammer that visited your site, how would you do it? I’ll post the best ideas in a future issue of my blog.</p>

			<p>> I LOVE this idea<br />
 <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> Thanks. I was afraid that I was too spoiled to consider this idea as good or funny. I&#8217;m still afraid, but at least I&#8217;m not alone.</p>
<p>> if you ever want someone to work on it with you, I can help..<br />
Unfortunately, not me. My TODO list is overloaded, and I have to cancel even the useful and interesting ideas.</p>

			<p>yea, I know how it goes..</p>
<p>Anyway&#8230; I was thinking about this and the advertisers might get mad about &#8220;false clicks&#8221; if we redirected the spammers to an amazon page or other advertiser links.</p>

			<p>Yes, this would piss off the advertisers or the affiliate program.<br />
A bad idea if put into practice, not a bad idea in theory, though.</p>

			<p>I have for some time redirected comment-spammeing bots to a search engine with the spammers ip and the word spam in the query stirng.</p>
<p>Like</p>
<p>response.redirect &#8220;http://google.com?q=spam+&#8221; &amp; request.servervariables(&#8221;REMOTE_ADDR&#8221;)<br />
response.end</p>
<p>It is not that the spammer him or herself see this, since the commentspamming is usually done via zoombied PCs (who are in fact innocent of anything else than having lousy security).</p>
<p>Yet it gives me a feeling of revenge&#8230; Since there will in some cases be a GET after the POST, pt. often by another IP - to see, if the message got through. It might end up in some spammers DB giving him some thoughts.</p>
<p>Also I have been experimenting with redirecting to a page that redirected to another page that redirected&#8230; funny to see how long they are willing to go. Actually I only used this for a while. Still have to remember the majority of spammers IPs are innocent users, and it will use their bandwidth&#8230;</p>
