<p>All tests are passed, and now I think that conversion from SXML to libxml2 is working and stable.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>In the previous post I announced that <a href="/blog/2005/03/23/namespaces-are-finished/">namespaces are finished</a>. At that moment I was near the end. The only things to do were:</p>
<ul>
<li> Fix conversion of processing instructions. The PI targets are the Scheme symbols, not the Scheme strings.
</li>
<li> Check escaping of the XML special symbols in XMLs generated.
</li>
</ul>
<p>All is done, and the conversion code is complete.</p>
<p>Honestly, some things are not supported (and probably will never be supported):</p>
<ul>
<li> TOP metadata: namespace definitions can't be mapped to the root node in libxml2 (I might be wrong).
</li>
<li> "ENTITY" special node: it's never used.
</li>
<li> PI metadata: it's never used.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now it's time to think on further development. I think that it's a good idea to work on a reverse conversion from XML to SXML. I'm going to implement a Scheme function "x:context-node" which returns a context node of an XSLT transformation as SXML.</p>
