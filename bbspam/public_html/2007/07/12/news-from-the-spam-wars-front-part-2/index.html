				<div class="KonaBody"><p>(Continued from <a href="../../09/news-from-the-spam-wars-front-part-1/index.html">part 1</a>.) Gather around Generals, I have hot intelligence straight from the high-tech weapons arsenal. The tide of the War Against Forum SPAM is turning.  </p>
<p>With CAPTCHA, Spam Blacklists, and other low-grade weapons allowing the front lines of our defenses to be overrun, a new anti-SPAM weapon has hit the battlefield and initial reports are quite favorable.</p>
<p><span id="more-9"></span></p>
<h2>Human Intelligence Thwarts The Robotic SPAM Army</h2>
<p>As I mentioned in <a href="../../09/news-from-the-spam-wars-front-part-1/index.html">Part 1</a>, forum SPAM is mostly all about links and money. Find a defensive strategy that makes it near impossible for spammers to automatically post their messages, and they’ll take their battle to places where the resistance isn’t as strong. </p>
<p>That weapon has been invented and it’s based upon a concept that no SPAM robot has yet been able to duplicate – Human Intelligence.</p>
<p>This revolutionary new weapon in the SPAM Wars uses <i><a href="http://bbantispam.com/atc/">Advanced Textual Confirmation</a></i> (ATC) to challenge anyone at the point where data is submitted through a posting form. Unlike CAPTCHA, which depends upon the user entering a string of random numbers that are often so visually distorted that people can no longer decipher them, and that have been cracked by spammers anyway, ATC has an almost human-like conversation with the user.</p>
<p>OK, maybe <i>conversation</i> is a bit of an exaggeration, but the short exchange of words is just as effective as the “Halt, Who Goes There?�? challenge that military perimeter guards have been using to tell good guys from bad for hundreds of years. It’s just a bit more high-tech.</p>
<p>ACT works by asking a random question that humans find easy to comprehend, but powers down SPAM robots in an instant. We’re talking simple questions like “What is a color? Red, zebra, tuxedo�? You can answer that, right? Great, you must be a good guy, come on in! Are the SPAM Wars over? Not yet, but they soon might be.</p>
