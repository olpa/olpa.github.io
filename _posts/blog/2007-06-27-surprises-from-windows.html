<p>I've spent at least an hour tracking down an error in integration of my software with another software. Finally, I've found that Windows (ok, <tt>command.com/cmd.exe</tt>) command <tt>chdir</tt> isn't so easy. If one wants to go to a directory on another drive, the flag <tt>/D</tt> must be used, otherwise nothing happens. Did you know it?</p>
