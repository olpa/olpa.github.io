<p>I visited as lurker <a href="http://syrcodis.ispras.ru/2005/">Spring Colloquium for Young Researchers in Databases and Information Sytems</a> (SYRCoDIS'2005). Quality of some talks was poor, but overall I liked the event very much. Moreover, I've got new knowledge and had meetings on scientific and business topics. I'm looking forward to SYRCoDIS'2006.</p>
