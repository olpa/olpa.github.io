<p>The <a href="http://xtech06.usefulinc.com/schedule">XTech 2006 shedule</a> is ready. The <a href="http://xtech06.usefulinc.com/schedule/detail/44">talk on XSieve</a> is sheduled to the last day, 19 May.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>I've looked through the shedule and found an unpleasant collision. I'd like to visit the both talks: "<a href="http://xtech06.usefulinc.com/schedule/detail/120">Case Study of an Implementation of XML Authoring Within the Open University</a>" by Sean Scannell and "<a href="http://xtech06.usefulinc.com/schedule/detail/84">Etna, a wysiwyg XML RELAXNG- and Gecko-based editor</a>" by Daniel Glazman, but the talks run simultaneously.</p>
<p>My paper is nearly finished, and now I'm bothered by only two issues.</p>
<p>* Should I buy a suit, or is default programmers' wearing ok?<br />
* Where can I find time to update the site and resume?</p>
