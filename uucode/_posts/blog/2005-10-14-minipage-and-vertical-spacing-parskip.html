<p>I noticed that my \parskip was ignored by the "minipage" environment. After some investigations I found that many vertical spacing commands have a special behaviour inside a minipage, and that the command "if@minipage" is used quite often.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Here are <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex/browse_thread/thread/8facf46eec6e5f26/ae9a34afc02115f6#ae9a34afc02115f6">my questions in comp.text.tex</a>:</p>
<p>What is the reason for such behaviour?</p>
<p>Where could I read about it?</p>
<p>By the way, here is how I restore the value of a \parskip inside a "minipage":</p>
<pre>
\\let\\V@oldminipagerestore\\@minipagerestore
\\def\\@minipagerestore{\\V@oldminipagerestore
  \\setlength{\\parskip}{X plusY minusZ}}
</pre>
<p>I'm not sure it is the right way, but I don't see an alternative.</p>
