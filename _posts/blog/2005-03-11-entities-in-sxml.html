<p>My letter to the ssax-sxml mailing list:</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>the SXML specification allows only one sort of entities, namely, unexpanded entities. The only use for them is in XMLs like this:</p>
<pre>
[code]
&lt;!DOCTYPE zzz [
...
&lt;!ENTITY figure1 SYSTEM "image1.cgm" NDATA CGM>
...
]>
&lt;img entity="figure1"/>
[/code]
</pre>
<p>But I want to use "normal" entities:</p>
<pre>
[code]
&amp;product;&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; AAA
[/code]
</pre>
<p>Unfortunately, this sort of entities doesn't fit to SXML specification. So I'm going to use my SXML dialect for them (*REF* is for "reference"):</p>
<pre>
[code]
... (*REF* "product") (*REF* "nbsp") (*REF* "mdash") " AAA" ...
[/code]
</pre>
<p>Any objection to the approach? Will you use the same method if you will need such entities?</p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>1. I found a letter in archives:</p>
<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=7743681">http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=7743681</a></p>
<p>It suggests trying a the existing SXML notation *ENTITY*. But, in my opinion, it's just an ugly workaround, not a clean solution.</p>
<p>2. Please look at the sample XML above. One can't convert it to SXML tree without losing information that the entity name was "figure1" (but I don't know if it is a problem or not).</p>
