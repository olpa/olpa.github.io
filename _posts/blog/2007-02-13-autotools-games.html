<p>After long break, I returned back to XSieve and found that the new tools doesn't compile the sources.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Many errors are easy to fix, I need only to explicitely specify the type conversion. I made few changes, and re-run make to get the location of the next errors. Instead, I got serious problems:</p>
<pre>
$ make stox.o
...
stox.c:7:28: error: libxml/globals.h: No such files or directory
In file included from sxml.h:9,
                 from stox.c:8:
stox.h:10:35: error: libxml/xpathInternals.h: No such files or directory
...
</pre>
<p>My CFLAGS went away!</p>
<p>I had to spend a lot of time on the dark area of autotools just to understand that the correct command line was:</p>
<pre>
$ make xsieve_sourceforge_net_la-stox.o
...
</pre>
<p>Awesome.</p>
