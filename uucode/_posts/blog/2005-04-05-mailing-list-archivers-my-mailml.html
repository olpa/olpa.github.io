<p>Ian Bicking <a href="http://blog.ianbicking.org/mailing-list-archivers.html">writes</a> about his disappointment with mail archivers. He even was starting to feel like he should just code himself. Just as I some time ago!</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>But we both came to the similar conclusion. Citing him:</p>
<blockquote><p>Maybe I should look at this as an "opportunity". But dear lazyweb, I am very willing to ride on other people's coat tails, just tell me whose...</p></blockquote>
<p>But the big differences in our approaches are technical details. I'd like to introduce MailML, a format for specifying the structure in mail messages. The possible logical blocks are titles, attachments, cites, signatures, urls, addresses and other. The MailML documents can be stored in XML database and queried through the web, something like <a href="http://www.syncato.org/">Syntaco</a>. It should be an ultimately powerful system.</p>
<p>I sure it's a business opportunity. But I don't have time to try it. Unfortunately.</p>
