<p>Not a first time when I need to trace a LaTeX layout by digging into the details, and again I've spend time remembering how to do it. Fixing the magic in writing.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>First, content should be wrapped by a box:</p>
<pre>
\\newsavebox{\\xxx}
\\savebox{\\xxx}{
... content ...
}
</pre>
<p>Now dump it into the log-file:</p>
<pre>
\\showboxdepth=100
\\showboxbreadth=100
\\showbox\\xxx
</pre>
<p>The non-obvious thing here is setting <tt>showboxdepth</tt> and <tt>showboxbreadth</tt>. For some reason, LaTeX disables box-printing by setting these values to -1. I don't know where from one could know about it.</p>
<p>Finally, return the box to the document:</p>
<pre>
\\usebox{\\xxx}
</pre>
