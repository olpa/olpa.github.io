<p>By me, vmware doesn't start without twicks. A normal rum produces something like:</p>
<p><tt>process 3954: Attempt to remove filter function 0xb6ad0690 user data 0xb7896048, but no such filter has been added<br />
D-Bus not built with -rdynamic so unable to print a backtrace</tt></p>
<p>In my case the solution is to start HAL daemon before running vmware.</p>
