<p>Hard to believe, but I forget to release <a href="http://consodoc.com/">Consodoc</a> after the two-week beta period. Yesterday I read the announce of the new version of SCons, 0.96.93, and decided to close the task as soon as possible. Today I've tested Consodoc with the new SCons and announced the software.</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>if you are interested in XML publishing, you might be also interested in my new development, Consodoc publishing server:</p>
<p><a href="http://consodoc.com/">http://consodoc.com/</a></p>
<p>Consodoc helps to re-use LaTeX (plain TeX, ConTeXt etc) skills in the XML world. Generally, this framework automates the following steps:</p>
<p>* Making LaTeX from XML,<br />
* running LaTeX binary to get PDF,<br />
* diff/patch management.</p>
<p>At the your side, you have to write</p>
<p>* an XSLT program to convert XML to LaTeX, and<br />
* a class file (or you can use the standard classes).</p>
<p>Thanks to TeXML, you need only the basics of XSLT to rewrite XML tags to LaTeX environments. And writing a class file is an easy task for an experienced LaTeX developer.</p>
<p>Visit the Consodoc home page to download the software, read the User's Guide, learn the benefits and suggested workflow:</p>
<p><a href="http://consodoc.com/">http://consodoc.com/</a></p>
<p>Consodoc is free for open source projects, and is payware for business. Hint: the end of the year is near, the rest of IT budgets should be spend somehow. Consodoc is a good opportinuty. Purchase it.</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I've just released Consodoc 1.0.0, a new tool for XML to PDF publishing, and now I'm looking for early adopters. You ought to be one of them if you are agree with the following statement:</p>
<p>&gt; Automatically generated documentation isn't necessary ugly. The only excuse is the current state of the art with tools that suck.</p>
<p>Consodoc is probably the only publishing tool that concentrates on the beauty of the result.</p>
<p>Consodoc publishing server: XML to beautiful documents<br />
<a href="http://consodoc.com/">http://consodoc.com/</a></p>
<p>* XML is converted to PDF through TeXML and LaTeX.<br />
* It's possible to manually tune the generated layout.<br />
* Tunings are remembered and re-applied during re-generations.</p>
