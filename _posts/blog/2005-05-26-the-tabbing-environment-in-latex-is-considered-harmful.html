<p>Some time ago I got a complaint on TeXML: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=7275865&forum_id=44318">Bug in TeXML</a>. Unfortunately, it's not a bug in TeXML, but it's a big bug in the LaTeX design.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Problem is that the "tabbing" environment redefines the commands "<tt>\`</tt>", "<tt>\'</tt>", "<tt>\"</tt>" and some others. From the <a href="http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=tabacc">TeX FAQ on tabbing</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
This is really a rather ghastly feature of the <tt>tabbing</tt> environment; in order to type accented characters you need to use the <tt>\a</tt> kludge: so <tt>\a'{e}</tt> inside tabbing for <tt>\'{e}</tt> outside, and similarly <tt>\a'</tt> for <tt>\'</tt> and <tt>\a=</tt> for <tt>\=</tt>. This whole procedure is of course hideous and error-prone.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The best solutions I see are as follows.<br />
* Don't use the "tabbing" environment.<br />
* Use the environment "Tabbing" (note the capital "T").</p>
<p>Obviously, I can't force users to follow these advices. Instead, I should change TeXML somehow. Probably I'll add mode "tabbing". I don't know when.</p>
