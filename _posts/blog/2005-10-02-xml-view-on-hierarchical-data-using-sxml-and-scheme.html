<p>My post-<a href="http://www.di.uminho.pt/GTTSE2005">GTTSE'2005</a> paper is ready. Abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Hierarchical data could be viewed and processed as XML using the SXML format and Scheme language. We introduce a symmetry constraint on this approach, reveal the weak points of the SXML representation, and discuss mapping between XML and SXML.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The main goal of the paper is to be a checklist and food for thought for implementors. It summarizes my experience in this projects:</p>
<p>* <a href="http://pysch.sourceforge.net/ast.html">Python AST as XML</a><br />
* <a href="http://uucode.com/texts/xfind/index.html">find with XPath over file system</a>, and<br />
* especially <a href="http://xsieve.sourceforge.net/index.html">XSieve</a>.</p>
<p>At the moment, the paper isn't available online. I'm waiting for acceptance of rejection. But I can e-mail a copy, if you are interested.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, it was very hard to write the paper. It took a month, and it could take more unless deadline. As result, I haven't used a kind proposal of Martin Bravenboer to send him a draft for review.</p>
<p>I'm not sure the paper will be accepted. But it's not very important. Important is that I described unexpected surprises of implementing XML virtual machine, and a next implementation will be better.</p>
