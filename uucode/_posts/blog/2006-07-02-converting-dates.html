<p>Inspired by Google feature of converting units, such as "20 euro to usd", I tried to ask for "Sat, 1 Jul 2006 14:01:40 -0700 PDT to GMT". Unfortunately, Google don't understand it.<br />
<!--more--><br />
The fallback is to use my Linux:</p>
<pre><code>$ TZ=GMT date -d 'Sat, 1 Jul 2006 14:01:40 -0700 PDT'
date: Ð½ÐµÐ²ÐµÑÐ½Ð°Ñ? Ð´Ð°ÑÐ° `Sat, 1 Jul 2006 14:01:40 -0700 PDT'</code></pre>
<p>It is interpreted as a wrong date. I found that it's enough to drop redundancy (timezone shift and timezone name):</p>
<pre><code>$ TZ=GMT date -d 'Sat, 1 Jul 2006 14:01:40 PDT'
Ð¡Ð±Ñ ÐÑÐ»  1 21:01:40 GMT 2006</code></pre>
<p>The problem is solved. But I decided to test Google yet again, with the new format. Unfortunately, it haven't helped.</p>
