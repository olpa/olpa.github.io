<p>Yesterday I succeeded in writing a code for processing an auxiliary SXML list and reporting namespace definition pairs (prefix and URI). I thought I was still too far from finalizing namespaces, but today I've just finished it in less than half on hour. Unfortunately, the code has a bug.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Here is a small example of namespace conversion. SXML:</p>
<pre>
(e1 (@
    (ns:a1 "a1")
    (@ (*NAMESPACES* (ns "myns"))))
  (e2 (@
      (ns:a2 "a2")))))
</pre>
<p>XML:</p>
<pre>
&lt;e1 xmlns:ns="myns" ns:a1="a1">
  &lt;e2 ns:a2="a2"/>
&lt;/e1>
</pre>
<p>I decided to provide a similar example and found a bug. At the moment of writing, SXML</p>
<pre>
(e1 (@
    (ns:a1 "a1")
    (@ (*NAMESPACES* (ns "myns"))))
  (e2 (@
      (ns:a2 "a2")
      (@ (*NAMESPACES* (ns "yourns")))))))
</pre>
<p>is resulting in</p>
<pre>
&lt;e1 xmlns:ns="yourns" ns:a1="a1">
  &lt;e2 xmlns:ns="yourns" ns:a2="a2"/>
&lt;/e1>
</pre>
<p>The bug is that "xmlns:ns" at "e1" should be "myns", not "yours". The first attempt on fixing is failed, giving up.</p>
<p>And I should also test default namespace.</p>
