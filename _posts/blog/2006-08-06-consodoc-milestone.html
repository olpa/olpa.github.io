<p>Finally, all the functional tests (at the moment, 34) for <a href="http://consodoc.com/">consodoc</a> are written and passed. The rest is easy: walk through FIXME file and make refactoring, create distro, create site and publish an announce. The middle of August is reasonable estimation for the first release.</p>
