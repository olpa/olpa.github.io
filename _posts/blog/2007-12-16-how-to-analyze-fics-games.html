<p>I play chess on <a href="http://freechess.org/">freechess.org</a>. Sometmes I like how I play. But the sad truth is that my good play is illusion. Thanks computers to reveal me a lot of mistakes.</p>
<p>Here is how I feed the games to the computer.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2>Step 1: get the game</h2>
<p>In FICS console, say (to get the games in the PGN format)</p>
<pre>fics% set pgn 1</pre>
<p>To get the list of recetly played games:</p>
<pre>fics% history olpa</pre>
<p>In the output, the first number is the game number. To get the game by e-mail, say:</p>
<pre>fics% mailstored olpa game_number</pre>
<h2>Step 2: analyze</h2>
<p>Just use your favourite chess program. I use <a href="http://www.craftychess.com/">crafty</a>.</p>
<p>At the moment, I use the command:</p>
<pre>annotate game.pgn wb x-999 .1 10</pre>
<p>Details are in the documentation.</p>
<p>After annotating is finished, I use gvim or XBoard to see crafty comments:</p>
<pre>$ xboard -lgf game.pgn.can</pre>
