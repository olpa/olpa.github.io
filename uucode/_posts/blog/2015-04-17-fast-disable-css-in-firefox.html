<p>Sometimes I want to read a web page without its design "improvements". In many case it is enough to switch off css, and in firefox this functionality is built-in. <tt>Shift+F7</tt> to get the developer tools. Thanks stackoverflow for the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/11347421/327725">hint</a>.</p>
