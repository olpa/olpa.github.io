<p>Sometimes it's very unhelpful when vim automatically adds a linebreak at the end of file. Finally, I've became so irritated to switch to joe each time to correct the file, that I've found a solution.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>It's very simple. It's enough to say:</p>
<pre>:set noeol bin</pre>
<p>After this the <tt>:w</tt> command writes the file without the last linebreak. But generally do not do this because a linebreak should normally always be at the end of a text file.</p>
