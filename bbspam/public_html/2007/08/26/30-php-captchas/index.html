			<div class="entry">
				<div class="KonaBody"><p>Recently I analyzed <a href="http://www.hotscripts.com/?RID=N606112">HotScripts.com</a> section &#8220;PHP :: Scripts and Programs :: Security Systems&#8221;. Looking through the all 9 pages, I identified 5 categories:</p>
<p>* CAPTCHAs,<br />
* crawler protection,<br />
* login, users, groups, roles, rights, authentification,<br />
* data encryption,<br />
* PHP and HTML source code encryption.</p>
<p>As one expects, the biggest category is &#8220;CAPTCHAs&#8221;. But how to select the best one?</p>
<p><span id="more-25"></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;m very sorry to disappoint you, but I have no answer. I think I know some criteria to decide if a captcha is good or bad (more on it later), but analyzing each of 30 scripts is a bit too hard work.</p>
<p>Fortunately, in programming, we usually have a correlation between the quality of a tool and its description. This way you can semiautomatically disqualify the most of the script.</p>
<p>Print this list, strike out what you dislike and write in comments what you&#8217;ve got. I&#8217;ll try manually review the scripts which get votes.</p>

<p>Anyways this one ended up being my favorite:<br />
