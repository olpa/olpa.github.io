<p>For historical reasons, my home wifi router uses a WEP 128-bit HEX key. It caused troubles while installing a Mac. The setup program accepted only 40-bit keys. Fortunately, the workaround is simple. Specify to use WEP with password, and as the password set "<tt>$0123...012345</tt>" -- the character <tt>$</tt> (dollar) followed by the key.</p>
