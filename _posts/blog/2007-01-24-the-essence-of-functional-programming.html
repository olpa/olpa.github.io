<p>I've transcripted the code examples from the paper "The essence of functional programming" by Philip Wadler.</p>

<blockquote><p>
This paper explores the use monads to structure functional programs. No prior knowledge of monads or category theory is required.</p>
<p>Monads increase the ease with which programs may be modified. They can mimic the effect of impure features such as exceptions, state, and continuations; and also provide effects not easily achieved with such features. The types of a program reflect which effects occur.</p>
<p>The first section is an extended example of the use of monads. A simple interpreter is modified to support various extra features: error messages, state, output, and non-deterministic choice. The second section describes the relation between monads and continuation-passing style. The third section sketches how monads are used in a compiler for Haskell that is written in Haskell.
