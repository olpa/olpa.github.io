<p>Yesterday I updated libxml2 and xsltproc from CVS and got a coredump. I am very scared because I can't produce a test case and I think that the problem is on libxml's side.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Fortunately, I found a workaround at least. In the file "xpath.c" find the code fragment:</p>
<pre>
#ifdef LIBXML_PATTERN_ENABLED
#define XPATH_STREAMING
#endif
</pre>
<p>Change this code to:</p>
<pre>
#ifdef LIBXML_PATTERN_ENABLED
#define XPATH_STREAMING
#undef XPATH_STREAMING
#endif
</pre>
<p>Streaming is probably a good idea, but I'd better wait till the core for it is debugged well.</p>
<p>And I ought to write to mailing list and ask to make a switch for the "configure" script. It's not very good to edit code after each CVS update.</p>

<p><a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/xml/2005-May/msg00014.html">I've wrote</a> to the libxml mailing list, and a patch appeared in CVS. Here is what fixed the problem:</p>
<pre>
$ diff xpath.c xpath.c.r1.288

< namespaces = xmlMalloc(2 * (ctxt->nsNr + 1) * sizeof(xmlChar*));

> namespaces = xmlMalloc(2 * (ctxt->nsNr + 1));
