<p>Finally, <a href="http://consodoc.com/">Consodoc publishing server</a> is released as beta. Consodoc assist with getting beautiful PDFs from XML. The main features are:<br />
* XML is converted to PDF through TeXML and LaTeX.<br />
* It's possible to manually tune the generated layout.<br />
* Tunings are remembered and re-applied during re-generations.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Now I'm preparing for a new project, DocBook TeXML stylesheets. Obviously, with Consodoc integration. I'll get the following team:</p>
<p>* TeXML,<br />
* Consodoc,<br />
* DocBook TeXML stylesheets.</p>
<p>It will be an important player in the world of technical documentation. XSL-FO will not die, but its popularity will be decreased.</p>
