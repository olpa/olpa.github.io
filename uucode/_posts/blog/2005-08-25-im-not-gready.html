<p>I like <a href="http://kynosarges.de/">Kynosarges</a>' comment on the <a href="http://datahansa.com/th/">Tree Help Plugin for Structured FrameMaker</a>.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<blockquote><p>
Another software nugget for users of Structured FrameMaker: DataHansa's Tree Help Plugin can expand the structure tree view to the current text position, a crucial function that's inexplicably missing from FrameMaker's ancient GUI. DataHansa asks a rather steep price of US$30 or &euro;25 for this rather trivial utility... but the defect is so annoying I'll probably buy it anyway.
</p></blockquote>
<p>While I agree that the utility is trivial, I disagree that it is overpriced. First, it saves time and nerves, which can't be compared with US$29.95 (not US$30 :-). Second, FrameMaker is not for home users, and a lower price isn't serious for business users.</p>
