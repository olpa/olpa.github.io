<p>I have a forum and get the following benefits:</p>
<p>* The forum is used for support. I don't worry about support requests lost in the e-mail spam.<br />
* I get SEO phrases and words from the real users.<br />
* I get testimonials and don't worry if I can publish them on my site.</p>
<p>I use phpBB. Thanks to my <a href="http://bbantispam.com/">bbAntiSpam tools</a>, the site visitors can write without registering. Probably it's one of the reasons why the forum is alive.</p>
