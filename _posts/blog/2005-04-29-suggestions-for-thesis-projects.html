<p>In comp.text.tex, Tristan Miller <a href="http://www.google.com/groups?lr=&selm=4041728.8tjGUmDvru%40ID-187157.News.Individual.NET">asked</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Can anyone recommend some small to medium-sized open problems which satisfy all of the four points below?</p></blockquote>
<p><!--more--> </p>
<p>Here are projects which I'd like to work on, but have no time for them.</p>
<h2>1) web2scheme</h2>
<p>Most TeX distributions are based on the web2c program which translates the TeX source code to C. As an alternative, it may be useful to develop a converter to the Scheme programming language.</p>
<p>The main idea is to port TeX to new platforms (such as ,NET) without rewriting TeX itself. Scheme is quite good as an intermediate language.</p>
<p>More, due to the Scheme nature, it should be possible to semiautomatically refactor the Scheme code and get a basis for the TeX improvement. It's the second main idea: TeX is a program which transforms a lot of lists of tokens, and there are languages which are good in it, and one of them has the phrase "list processing" in its name.</p>
<p>At least, such system should beat the sTeXme project: <a href="http://stexme.sourceforge.net/">http://stexme.sourceforge.net/</a></p>
<h2>2) TeXML processors for different languages</h2>
<p>TeXML (<a href="http://getfo.sourceforge.net/texml/">http://getfo.sourceforge.net/texml/</a>) is an XML vocabulary for TeX. The processor transforms TeXML markup into the TeX markup, escaping special and out-of-encoding characters. The intended audience is developers who automatically generate [La]TeX or ConTeXt files.</p>
<p>At the moment, the converter from TeXML to TeX is available only in Python. More languages are required.</p>
<h2>3) DocBook to LaTeX/ConTeXt</h2>
<p>If we ignore tables, it's not very hard to develop a converter from DocBook to LaTeX or ConTeXt using XSLT and TeXML. Due to these tools, such converter may be more robust and of easier maintenance than dblatex or db2latex.</p>
<p>Some steps in this direction are already done, see the XML2TeXML project: <a href="http://xml2texml.sourceforge.net/">http://xml2texml.sourceforge.net/</a></p>
<p>And the CALS tables converter is the task for me.</p>
<h2>4) LaFO</h2>
<p>XSL-FO is a W3C standard which defines an XML vocabulary for specifying formatting semantics.</p>
<p>Converting XML directly to XSL-FO is a quite low-level task. Instead, it's better to develop some intermediate set of styles (let call it LaFO) which defines default formatting properties for paragraphs, lists and other elements.</p>
<p>LaFO for XSL-FO is like LaTeX for TeX.</p>
