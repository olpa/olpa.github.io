<p>According to many specialists, this is a hard CAPTCHA for machine recognition. Anyway, the developers (they call themselves &#8220;Network Security Research and AI group&#8221;) designed a system with the recognition rate about 35%.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t reveal the algorithm. The only detail is that the tool uses uses MATLAB 2007a Compiler Runtime.</p>
<p>The code is freely available for download.</p>
<p>The developers notified Yahoo, but haven&#8217;t got a reply so far.</p>

			<p>Something tells me Yahoo! is working on this,It&#8217;s easy to bypass the captcha once you know the code of it, Yahoo! needs to make a new code without sharing it. and also add alot of new things to it as well.</p>

			<p>This captcha is upsetting me on Yahoo! mail. Every time I try to send an email it comes up. I put in the letters and numbers as it shows and it locks me out of the system for 24 hours. I have given feedback to Yahoo twice now on this issue. I have talked to others and it seems no one else is having this issue. It has gotten so bad that I had to creat an email through google. If anyone has some ideas of how to get rid of this captcha crap I would definitely be inclined to listen.</p>
