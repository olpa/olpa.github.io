<p>I'm always spending lots of time searching for these information: "<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/percent.mspx">Using batch parameters</a>", "<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/batch.mspx">Using batch files</a>", "<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/ntcmds_shelloverview.mspx">Command shell overview</a>".</p>

<p>I need it to write batch file for Windows. It's a part of trade-off between usability and development time.</p>
<p>If I create a Perl script for processing files, my Windows users can do nothing with the script. My solution is quite simple, but working. In addition to the Perl script, I also create a batch file which is just a wrapper for the Perl script.</p>
<p>Installation procedure: user creates a link to the batch file at the Windows Desktop. Usage procedure: user selects files to be processed and drags them on the link. All is quite simple.</p>
<p>By the way, the batch file looks as follows:</p>
<pre>
perl %~dp0script.pl %*
pause
</pre>
