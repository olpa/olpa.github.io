<p>Recently I started a new blog "<a href="http://bbspam.com/">Spam Bots and CAPTCHAs</a>" (will be announced later). I plan to have many authors on this blog, therefore I disliked that the blog postings were not annotated by the author names. After some investigations, I found that it was the default WordPress behaviour. The fix was simple.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Just add something like</p>
<p><code>
<pre style="color:#000000;background:#ffffff;">by <span style="color:#a65700; background:#ffffe8; ">&lt;?php</span><span style="color:#000000; background:#ffffe8; "> the_author_link</span><span style="color:#808030; background:#ffffe8; ">(</span><span style="color:#808030; background:#ffffe8; ">)</span><span style="color:#800080; background:#ffffe8; ">;</span><span style="color:#000000; background:#ffffe8; "> </span><span style="color:#a65700; background:#ffffe8; ">?></span>
</pre>
<p></code></p>
<p>to the template files:</p>
<p>* archive.php<br />
* index.php<br />
* search.php<br />
* single.php</p>
<p>There is a number of alternatives to "<tt>the_author_link</tt>". Details are in the documentation.</p>
