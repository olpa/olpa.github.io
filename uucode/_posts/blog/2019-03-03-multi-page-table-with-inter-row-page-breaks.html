<p>Usually it is a bad idea to break table inside a row. But people do want it. <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.text.tex/gE80AAOQ83U/woX-CFfUQYEJ">Once</a> I sketched a quick dirty hack for latex <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/cals">cals package</a> and since then I've got several support requests. It seems now I have to support the code.</p>
<p>The current version can be found as github gist: <a href="https://gist.github.com/olpa/2a7096b231d0dbe2b022122b1674b4ff">tblbrk.tex</a>.</p>
