				<div class="KonaBody"><p>I don&#8217;t have the problem of spam in <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> (thanks <a href="http://bbantispam.com/atc/">Advanced Textual Confirmation</a>), but anyway investigated the state of the art in order to decide, if it worths to promote ATC for WordPress. Here is a small report.</p>
<p><span id="more-11"></span></p>
<p>The search by the word &#8220;spam&#8221; at wordpress.org gives the following official pages:</p>
<p>* <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Combating_Comment_Spam">Combating Comment Spam</a><br />
* <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Combating_Comment_Spam/FAQ">Combating Comment Spam FAQ</a><br />
* <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins/Spam_Tools">Plugins / Spam Tools</a></p>
<p>As expected, the main effort is spent on protecting from the comment spam. Different sorts of CAPTCHAs, Filtering, obfuscation of forms, etc, etc are proposed.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s unique to blogging, is the trackback spam. The WordPress approaches so far are:</p>
<p>* Pre-moderation<br />
* Heuristics<br />
* Checking the trackback link really exists (isn&#8217;t it pingpack?)</p>
<p>Each of these approaches has drawbacks. There are no ideal solutions. I think I know how to improve one of the approaches, but I don&#8217;t want to disclose the idea yet. Read the blog to be notified.</p>
<p>The third type of the spam &#8212; registration spam &#8212; isn&#8217;t covered at all. Therefore, if you build a community around your blog, you have no other choice but install <a href="http://bbantispam.com/atc/">Advanced Textual Confirmation</a>.</p>
