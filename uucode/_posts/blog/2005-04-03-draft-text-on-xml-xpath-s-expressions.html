<p>I'm writing a paper (not for GTTSE2005 as the <a href="/blog/2005/04/03/im-participating-in-gttse2005/">previous entry</a> may suggest). Here is a bit of the text written today.</p>

<div class="section" id="xml">
<h2>XML</h2>
<p>Extensible Markup Language (XML, <em>ref</em>) is a text format<br />
which helps to represent a logical structure in documents.<br />
Example of a possible document in the XML format:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&lt;article id=&quot;hw&quot;&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;Hello&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;para&gt;Hello &lt;object&gt;World&lt;/object&gt;!&lt;/para&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
</pre>
<p>Ignoring details, one can said that XML documents consist<br />
of elements and attributes. Elements specify named text<br />
extents and attibutes curry properties. Elements should be<br />
properly nested, so any XML can be mapped to a tree.<br />
One of such mappings is described in the Document Object Model<br />
(DOM, <em>ref</em>) standard.</p>
<p>One of the keys in the success of XML is interoperability.<br />
When different legacy systems talk to each other, they usually<br />
speak in XML. Any data can be mapped to XML, but XML is the<br />
most natural for representing hierarchical data.</p>
<p>Another important side of XML is the plenty of standards.<br />
They cover most of issues related to data presentation,<br />
validation, transformation and exchange.</p>
<p>There are tools designed to work with XML, and sometimes<br />
instead of processing data inside an application itself,<br />
it's simplier to export data to XML, process them using<br />
XML tools and import the result back.</p>
<p>One of such tools are those which implement XPath (<em>ref</em>) and<br />
XSLT (<em>ref</em>) standards. XPath is a language for navigation over<br />
XML trees, and XSLT is a template language for XML tree<br />
transformations.</p>
<p>In this paper we concentrate mainly on XPath and leave<br />
XSLT for future work.</p>

<h2>XPath</h2>
<p>XPath(<em>ref</em>) is a language for navigating, matching and querying<br />
on XML data.</p>
<p>An XPath expression is a series of location steps divided by<br />
the slash symbol (<em>/</em>). A location step has three parts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>an axis, which specifies the tree relationship,</li>
<li>a node test, which specifies the node type, and</li>
<li>zero or more predicates, which use arbitrary expressions to filter nodes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example of an XPath expression:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
/child::article[attribute::id='hw']/child::para
</pre>
<p>This XPath consist of two location steps. The first step uses<br />
<em>child</em> axis to select all children of the root node, the node<br />
test filters those which are named <em>article</em>, and the predicate<br />
filters those which have an attribute <em>id</em> set to the value <em>hw</em>.<br />
The second step selects all the paragraphs (elements <em>para</em>) of<br />
the article selected.</p>
<p>There are also a number of syntactic abbreviations that allow common<br />
cases to be expressed concisely. For example, the previous XPath<br />
can be also written as:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
/article[&#64;id='hw']/para
</pre>
<p>A remarkable feature about XPath is that bloating tree-walking<br />
code in conventional languages can be replaced by short<br />
expressive XPath expressions.</p>

<div class="section" id="lisp-approaches">
<h2>Lisp approaches</h2>
<p>Lisp is a family of computer languages. The most popular<br />
dialects are Common Lisp (<em>ref</em>) and Scheme(<em>ref</em>).<br />
In Lisp, data is representing in so-called S-expressions(<em>ref</em>),<br />
or Symbolic Expressions, or &quot;sexps&quot;, defined recursively.</p>
<p>Just as XML, S-expressions can represent any data structures,<br />
including hierarchical, and Lisp is good in processing them.<br />
There are a lot of discussions on comparing S-expressions,<br />
Lisp and XML (for example, see <em>ref</em> and <em>ref</em>). In our work<br />
we use a combination of useful features of XML and Lisp worlds.</p>
