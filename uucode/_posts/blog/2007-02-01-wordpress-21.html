<p>I've upgraded <a href="http://wordpress.org/">wordpress</a> to the version 2.1. It wasn't very easy because the authors have broken incompatibility with older versions, therefore my tweaked theme stopped working. I hope I repaired everything. Also, I temporary switched off spam protection to see how active are the spammers now.</p>
