<blockquote><p>This document is about making screen captures for technical writers working primarily in a Microsoft Windows environment. The tools targeted include Adobe FrameMaker, Microsoft Word, Adobe Acrobat, along with Techsmith's SnagIt, Adobe Photoshop, and Ulead's PhotoImpact 4.2.</p>
<p>Certainly, the thoughts and techniques mentioned herein can be applied to other professions, other operating systems, and other tools.</p></blockquote>
