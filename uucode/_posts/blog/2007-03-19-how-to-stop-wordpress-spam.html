<p>My blog is protected by <a href="http://bbantispam.com/atc/">Advanced Textual Confirmation</a>.</p>
<p>* No more spam.<br />
* No complains from the visitors.</p>

<p>ATC is a generic tool, suitable for any PHP script. On my sites, it also protects phpBB forum and several Wikis.</p>
<p>Installation is simple, just follow the <a href="http://bbantispam.com/atc/install.html">instructions</a>. For WordPress, it's enough to modify only one file, <tt>wp-config.php</tt>. Add at the beginning:</p>
<pre>
require_once '...../bbantispam.php';
</pre>
<p>Trivial install, trivial maintenance.</p>
