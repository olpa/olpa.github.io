<p>Unit testing is good, but the actual behaviour of a program also should be tested.<br />
<!--more--><br />
I wanted not to re-invent the wheel, and looked for an existing tool. My first query to Google was "testing command line". Reiewing the results, I found <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/dejagnu/">DejaGnu</a> and realized that what I need is called "functional testing".</p>
<p>Then I looked <a href="http://dmoz.org/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing/Products_and_Tools/Open_Source/">at DMOZ</a> and also found several matches. I gave up using Google and DMOZ after I found the great resource:</p>
<p><a href="http://opensourcetesting.org/">http://opensourcetesting.org/</a><br />
<a href="http://opensourcetesting.org/functional.php">http://opensourcetesting.org/functional.php</a></p>
<p>My favourites are <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/dejagnu/">DejaGnu</a> and <a href="http://staf.sourceforge.net/">STAF</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, STAF is overkill for me.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, DejaGnu is Expect/Tcl.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I haven't found a python solution.</p>
<p>It seems I'm going to develop my own trivial functional testing script. All is as usual.</p>
