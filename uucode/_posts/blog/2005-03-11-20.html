<p>It's hard to create menu scripts for FrameMaker, even with help of FrameScript because there are a lot of details. So several months ago I wrote a generator of FrameScript (<b>fslgen</b>). Now I create XML-file with description of desired menu structure, describe handlers and properties, and the generator does all the dirty work.</p>
<p>When the software appeared first, it was a kind of experiment and just a tool to simplify my work. But now the generator is so essential part of the development process, that I can't understand how I programmed without it.</p>
<p>Right now I've finished alpha version of a maker of folios. There are a lot of PDFs possible which differ only in variants. In my solution, the possible variants and the differences are described in FrameMaker itself. <b>fslgen</b> takes the description and produces appropriate menus and scripts.

<p>Quite impressive, isn't it? And what's the more important -- users can change the menu structure without a programmer!</p>
