<p>I've updated "<a href="http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cals">cals</a>" package -- multipage tables with wide range of features -- to version 2.2. In the new version, alignment of tables should work. Also, I've added hooks for the package "bidi" (right-to-left writing support). CTAN is updated, and the coming TeX Live 2013 should include the new version.</p>
