<p>I need to reuse a function in a file. The usual way is just to import this file as a module. But what to do if the name is "bad"? The following doesn't work:</p>
<pre><code>
import foo-bar as foo_bar
foo_bar.callme()
</code></pre>
<p>After trials and errors, the desired magic found: </p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<pre><code>
foo_bar = __import__('foo-bar', globals(),  locals(), [], -1)
foo_bar.callme()
</code></pre>
<p>See Python Documentation for details: in some cases you don't want to use <tt>__import__</tt>.</p>
<p>The best solution is, obviously, to rename file. But I wanted to find an answer to this importing challenge.</p>
