<p>I never understand why, having such a victimable system as DNS, Internet is still alive. Now my understanding is giving up.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Yesterday I decided to read a bit of Joel. I selected his site from the bookmarks, but got a standard site of cybersquatters instead of Joel's site. I was surprised how Joel can lose his domain and looked up whois for details. And all was ok in it. After some investigations, I worked out that all is wrong with DNS:</p>
<pre>
$ host -a JOELONSOFTWARE.COM 195.19.225.253
Trying "JOELONSOFTWARE.COM"
Using domain server:
Name: XXX.XX.XXX.XXX
Address: XXX.XX.XXX.XXX#53
Aliases: 

;; ->>HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 17444
;; flags: qr rd; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 2, AUTHORITY: 1, ADDITIONAL: 1

;; QUESTION SECTION:
;JOELONSOFTWARE.COM.            IN      ANY

;; ANSWER SECTION:
JOELONSOFTWARE.COM.     99777   IN      A       83.222.5.155
JOELONSOFTWARE.COM.     99777   IN      A       83.222.5.156

;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
COM.                    99952   IN      NS      3sistersmassage.COM.

;; ADDITIONAL SECTION:
3sistersmassage.COM.    20771   IN      A       216.127.88.131

Received 114 bytes from XXX.XX.XXX.XXX#53 in 39 ms
</pre>
<p>where "XXX.XX.XXX.XXX" is the provider's DNS server.</p>
<p>Look at the "AUTHORITY SECTION". The value "COM." is ridiculous! How can it be? Is it possible to spam DNS now? Why not to fake a site IP for Microsoft Passport?</p>
<p>I'm afraid soon we'll upgrade Internet. E-mail is spam, and DNS smells danger.</p>
