<p>Babel allows LaTeX to speak multiple languages. It also introduces shorthands, one- or two-character sequences, which help non-English authors to type language-specific letters easily. Unfortunately, this feature leads to problems when generating LaTeX-files automatically.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>A simple example:</p>
<pre>
\\documentclass{article}
\\usepackage[english,german]{babel}
\\begin{document}
Variant "111de000" System\\par
Variant "111de000"~System\\par
\\chaptername
\\end{document}
</pre>
<p>Do you see an error here? No, unless you have experience typesetting German documents. Problem is here:</p>
<pre>
" S
"~S
</pre>
<p>Quote has a special meaning when German babel is activated. In the example above, it produces "SS" and "-S". There are more such shorthands, and there is a lot of languages. I can't add all of them to my script.</p>
<p>For automatic generation, it's better to switch shorthands off. But there is no such option. I haven't found it in documentation and <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.text.tex/browse_thread/thread/5fbd187d7807fd3d/6456d8adaa925a94">asked in comp.text.tex</a>. It seems that there is no nice way, the only thing I can do is to hook babel internals. There is a proposal from Morten Hogholm (see the thread), but I like my solution better:</p>
<p>File "lessbabel.sty":</p>
<pre>
\\NeedsTeXFormat{LaTeX2e}
\\ProvidesPackage{lessbabel}[2005/10/04 Babel without shorthands]

\\DeclareOption*{\\PassOptionsToPackage{\\CurrentOption}{babel}}
\\ProcessOptions\\relax
\\RequirePackage{babel}

\\def\\bbl@activate#1{} 
</pre>
<p>My generated documents now use</p>
<pre>
\\usepackage[english,german]{lessbabel}
</pre>
<p>instead of</p>
<pre>
\\usepackage[english,german]{babel} 
</pre>
