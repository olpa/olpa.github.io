				<div class="KonaBody"><p>You’ve probably heard of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C); it’s is an &#8220;international consortium where member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public work together to develop Web standards. </p>
<p>According to their web site, their mission is:</p>
<p>&#8220;To lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing protocols and guidelines that ensure long-term growth for the Web.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, lately they have been working hard to lead the web away from CAPTCHA, and with good reason. According to this <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/">article</a> on their web site, CAPTCHA is giving webmasters a &#8220;false sense of security.&#8221;</p>
<p><span id="more-47"></span></p>
<p>The recently published their findings on CAPTCHA which indicate that automated spam-bots can defeat CAPTCHA protection with between &#8220;88% and 100% accuracy.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they came up with something like 10 alternatives and guess what the #1 solution was? Logic puzzles. So here you have the W3C, with some of the greatest Internet-focused minds available, declaring the death of CAPTCHA and recommending that webmasters consider using &#8220;simple mathematical word puzzles, trivia, and the like to raise the bar for robots, at least to the point where using them is more attractive elsewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hey, I must be one of the greatest Internet-focused minds myself, because that’s what I’ve been trying to tell everyone for as long as I can remember.</p>
<p>If you want to beat the spam-bots at their own game, all you have to do is throw some text at them that they can’t possibly understand but that humans can blow through in a second. </p>
<p>And that’s what <a href="http://bbantispam.com/atc/">Advanced Textual Confirmation</a> does. Take a look at the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">full article</a>. Sure, you’ll see other recommendations such as Heuristic checks and Federated identity systems and public-key infrastructure solutions, but you won’t find a solution that’s as easy to integrate as Advanced Textual Confirmation, that’s for sure.</p>
