<p>XSieve 0.0.2 is the first public release of XSieve, a language which interweaves XSLT and Scheme.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>The source code of XSieve 0.0.2 is near the same as of XSieve 0.0.1, but 0.0.1 was a development snapshot and only very stubborn people could install it.</p>
<p>With XSieve 0.0.2, installation is standard:</p>
<p>* ./configure<br />
* make<br />
* make install</p>
<p>Some prerequisites are required, but they are also installable using the standard way. The installation process is described in full in the manual:</p>
