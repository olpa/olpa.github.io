<p>I don't make any presentation at the <a href="http://wiki.di.uminho.pt/wiki/bin/view/GTTSE/ParticipantsWorkshop" title="Participants Workshop of the summer school on Generative and Transformational Techniques in Software Engineering">GTTSE 2005</a>, but I want to share my ideas and get feedback. Specially for this conference, I've ordered and got a T-shirt with the buzz word "Generative XPath", this blog URL and words "Scheme" and "[La]TeX".</p>
