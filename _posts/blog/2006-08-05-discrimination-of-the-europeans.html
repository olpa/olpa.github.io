<p>Recently I got a complaint from an european user who wanted to buy bbAntiSpam. He was unpleasantly surprised that the actual price was two times more than the declared price.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>I use Plimus as re-seller. The price at Plimus was <b>$19.97</b>.</p>
<p>Most europeans prefer to pay ebay/amazon/etc by wire transfer from their online bankings. It's free and convinient.</p>
<p>The user decied to pay to Plimus the same way. To his surprise, he was charged additional fees:<br />
* for international transfer,<br />
* for manual processing on Plimus side.</p>
<p>As result, <b>$19.97</b> becomes <b>$36.17</b>. Unbelievable!</p>
<p>The easiest solution I found is to add a note:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The recommended payment method is credit card. Alternatives might cause additional fees. European users who want to pay by wire transfer (online banking) without fees, please contact us directly.
</p></blockquote>
