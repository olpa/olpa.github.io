<p>Some time ago I tried to compile XSieve for the win32 platform. I was partially successfull, I compiled everything except of the XSieve DLL itself. I'm not going to repeat the attempt in the near future, and I have to do something with the notes. The simplest solution is to put the notes to the blog for future reference.</p>

<p>----------------------------</p>
<p>Notes on compiling for Win32</p>
<p>1) First install MinGW, and only then MSYS. Then MSYS correctly integrates with MinGW</p>
<p>2) libtool -- install separately</p>
<p>3) GMP</p>
<p>4) PATH CFLAGS LDFLAGS<br />
-- for configure</p>
<p>*) GMP: can't be both shared & dynamic.<br />
Had to say guile --shared<br />
-<br />
scmconfig</p>
<p>*) regex.0.12 -- by hand. see forconf.</p>
<p>----------------------</p>
<p>Notes on compiling libxml2 and libxslt</p>
<p>libxml_modules_enables</p>
<p>1) libxml should made fix in area of xmlversion.h</p>
<p>libxml: -liconv -lws2_32 (+-lthread?)</p>
<p>2) xml-config from xml-configin manually, with corrected modules settings</p>
<p>3) libxslt: libiconv.la: correct libdir (iconv should be installed to c:\...)</p>
