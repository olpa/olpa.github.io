<p>The base for relative paths in "x:eval" is the XSLT context node. It wasn't possible to change the base in XSieve 1.0.0, and it was behaviour by design. I realized that it is a misfeature and corrected it in XSieve 1.0.1. More, a new example is introduced: "<a href="http://xsieve.sourceforge.net/ex-multsum.html">Miltiple sum, or quantity times price</a>."</p>
