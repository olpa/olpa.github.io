<p>Yesterday evening, trying to write <a href="/blog/2005/03/23/make-test/">the previous post</a>, I found that my blog isn't working. It's the third computer failire in the last days (here are the <a href="/blog/2005/03/20/internet-outage/">first one</a> and the <a href="/blog/2005/03/21/whats-up-with-dns/">second one</a>). Have I bad carma?</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>The problem was that WordPress didn't display any texts, including the digest on the main page and the individual pages. Instead, all dynamic blocks were annotated by messages like:</p>
<blockquote><p>WordPress database error: [Got error 28 from table handler]</p></blockquote>
<p>Googling immediately gave me an answer:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<a href="http://wiki.wordpress.org/?pagename=Error28">http://wiki.wordpress.org/?pagename=Error28</a></p>
<p>MySQL Error 28</p>
<p>    "Error code 28: No space left on device"</p>
<p>This is a MySQL error and has nothing to do with Word Press directly; you should contact your host about it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I immediately wrote to the hoster, but the problem was solved only today near the dinner. Probably the dinner time is a sysadmin's morning! I'm furious, but still afraid of relocating to another hoster.</p>
