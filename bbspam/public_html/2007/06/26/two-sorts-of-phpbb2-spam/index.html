				<div class="KonaBody"><p>I&#8217;ve just got a complaint from an user who purchased Textual Confirmation (TC). To his dissatisfaction, TC haven&#8217;t stopped spam. Investigations revealed that he gets spam in guest postings, which is outside of the scope of TC. To stop such spam, he actually needs <a href="http://bbantispam.com/atc/"><i>Advanced</i> Textual Confirmation</a>. The following is what I&#8217;ve answered.</p>
<p><span id="more-5"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m very sorry that I&#8217;ve made you unhappy. It&#8217;s my fault that text on the site are not very clear, and I&#8217;m going to re-write them in the nearest future. Here is a short explanation:</p>
<p>The are two sorts of spam in phpBB:</p>
<p>* spam messages, and<br />
* more subtle: spam registrations &#8212; user registers, but never posts.</p>
<p>Textual Confirmation stops the second sort. Indirectly, for the most of forums, it also stops the first spam, because usually only registered users can post.</p>
<p>However, you forum allows anonymous (guest) postings. It&#8217;s great for your visitors, and I always recommend such setup. The bad news is that you need another tool to stop guest spam.</p>
<p>This tool is Advanced Textual Confirmation (ATC): <a href="http://bbantispam.com/atc/">http://bbantispam.com/atc/</a><br />
See it in action in our forums (try post as a guest twice): <a href="http://bbantispam.com/forum/">http://bbantispam.com/forum/</a><br />
If you like the approach, uninstall Textual Confirmation and install ATC: <a href="http://bbantispam.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=284">http://bbantispam.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=284</a>
