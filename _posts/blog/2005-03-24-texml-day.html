<p>I wanted to work on generative XML, but I had to answer a letter from Paul Tremblay about new release of TeXML. Answering developed into working on TeXML.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>First of all, I'd like summarize most important new features introduced by Paul:</p>
<p>* support of standard Pythonic installation of modules,<br />
* namespaces,<br />
* better error handling.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some Makefiles didn't survive the changes, so I decided to updated them.</p>
<p>I introduced the script "texml_local" to use TeXML without installing it. It is not only convinient to casual users, but also essential to testing new changes.</p>
<p>Having "texml_local", it was easy to update "Makefile" for tests. Surprisingly, all tests were passed. And the "Makefile" for builing distribuition packages is quite generalized to allow simple changes. No problems.</p>
<p>And I submited a pair of bugs: "<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1169416&amp;group_id=102261&amp;atid=631460">print to stdout instead of stderr</a>" and "<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1169422&amp;group_id=102261&amp;atid=631460">setup.py corrections</a>".</p>
