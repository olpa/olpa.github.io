<p>There is a number of XML-editors, but there are no user-friendly ones (except FraemMaker). A standard XML editor is a tool for programmers, to play with XML. But technical writers need an user-centric XML editor, to play with a document, not with XML.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>If I were writing an user-friendly XML editor, my specification would cover the following.</p>
<p>WYSIWYG, real or pseudo.</p>
<p>CALS tables support.</p>
<p>Entities support: if an XML document contains entities, the editor must retain them. More, the editor should easily fold/unfold/edit nested entities on demand:</p>
<p>* an entity can appear as some visual symbol<br />
* an entity content can be diplayed in full<br />
* an user can edit an entity separately</p>
<p>Implicit transformations: for editing and formatting purposes, it could be useful to modify the document's structure while loading XML.</p>
<p>Advanced, hidden from an usual user: support of concurrent markup (multiple overlapping XML trees in one document).</p>
<p>Only basic DTD/Schema support, no need for an XSLT debugger and other programmer-centric tools.</p>
<p>Structure islands: allow to write as in Word, without any structure. Allow using XML only in parts of the document.</p>
