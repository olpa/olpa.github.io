<p>For XML to DocBook to .docx conversion, I found that "<a href="http://www.le-tex.de/en/transpect.html">le-tex transpect</a>" framework has solved many technical issues already, so I overcame the "not invented here syndrome" and decided to rely on this tool. To tune the stylesheets for own needs, I created a github copy of the repository: <a href="https://github.com/olpa/docxtools">docxtools</a>. To run the stylesheets outside the framework, a special setup is required. The setup is described in the folder "<tt>doc/hello-world</tt>".</p>
