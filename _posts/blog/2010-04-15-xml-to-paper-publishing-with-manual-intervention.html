<p>My paper "XML to paper publishing with manual intervention" is accepted for <a href="http://www.eseig.ipp.pt/conferencias/xata2010/index.php?lang=en">XATA 2010</a> (XML: Aplicações e Tecnologias Associadas), 19 and 20 May, Vila do Conde, Portugal. Abstract:</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Existing tools consider XML to paper conversion as one black box step and provide control only through predefined options. With this approach, tuning the layout of output documents is a burdensome task.</p>
<p>The paper advocates a new workflow for XML to paper conversion, in which a separate step allows the user to fine control the layout. The changes made by the user are remembered and later can be automatically re-applied during publishing an updated version of the document.</p>
<p>A possible technical implementation for the workflow is suggested. TeX is used as a typesetting engine. XML to TeX conversion is made using XSLT and TeXML. The management of changes is performed by diff and patch tools.</p>
