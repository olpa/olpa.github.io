<p>I'm going to visit (and speak) at <a href="http://www.xmlprague.cz/">XML Prague</a> 2007. Here is the great description of the conference by <a href="http://xmlguru.cz/">Jirka Kosek</a> (as a comment in the docbook-devel mailing list).</p>
<blockquote><p>I will use this opportunity to invite everyone to attend XML Prague 2007 (http://www.xmlprague.cz/). You will see and hear excellent speakers talking about up-to-date topics, as the conference is quite small (around 120-130 people) it has very cosy atmosphere. Moreover we made this conference for fun, not for money, so conference rate is ridiculously low. And if you have spare time you can spend few more days in Prague, which is very attractive touristic location (btw, conference itself is located in former monastery from 17th century).</p></blockquote>
