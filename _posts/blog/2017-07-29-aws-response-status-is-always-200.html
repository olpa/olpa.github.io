<p>There is a task, which can't be avoided when developing serverless applicatoins on Amazon Web Services:</p>
<p>How to return a custom status code from a REST API?</p>
<p>One of the approaches is to use "prefix mapping", like for example is shown in this amazon blog post: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/error-handling-patterns-in-amazon-api-gateway-and-aws-lambda/">Error Handling Patterns in Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda</a> by Bryan Liston.</p>
<p>The only problem is that the approach doesn't always work. After a long debuggin session with many false tries, I've found the reason.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>There is an AWS bug. More precisely, it is a feature because it is documented (<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-method-settings-execution-console.html">Set up Data Mappings between Method and Integration</a>)):</p>
<blockquote><p>If you use '.+' as the selection pattern to filter responses, be aware that it may not match a response containing a newline ('\n') character. </p></blockquote>
<p>Therefore, such a rule (from the referenced blog post) is wrong:</p>
<p><code>
<pre>Selection pattern: “^[BadRequest].*”</pre>
<p></code></p>
<p>The correct expression is:</p>
<p><code>
<pre>Selection pattern: “^[BadRequest](\n|.)*”</pre>
<p></code></p>
<p>The last question is: why the response message could contain newlines? Easily: they are produced by throwing an RuntimeException, and Java serializes the exception to a multi-line string.</p>
