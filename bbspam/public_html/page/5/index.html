					<p>The SPAM wars continue, and they’re not taking place a long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. They’re taking place in forums, Wikis and blogs right here and right now. And while the <i>good guys</i> always win in the movies, this real-life battle is too close to call. In fact, many of the good guys are dropping like flies or throwing their hands up in surrender as they cave in to the pressure of fighting off the spamming hordes. </p>

					<p>Geez, where do I begin? Spam&#8230;it&#8217;s all about spam. Why can&#8217;t we all live in a wonderful e-world, filled with blogs, picture streams, and wonderful myspaces&#8230; without the hassle of spam. I guess it&#8217;s just like anything else, it&#8217;s subject to users <em>and</em> abusers. Hustlers I call &#8216;em; Skid Row-ers I call &#8216;em.  Plain &#8216;ole scum of the Earth. What are we going to do? They are clever, very very clever&#8230; Well of course!&#8211; We must fight the fires with even clever-<em>er</em>(?) <img src='../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> methods. CAPTCHA was a god-send. That&#8217;s one way. The boys over at bbantispam have come up with a simple yet effective way to wade through the masses of complex, yet somewhat feeble in circumstances, spam bots. Why boys, can&#8217;t you even say &#8220;hello&#8221;? I love it. Keep it coming bbantispam&#8230;&#8217;cause I&#8217;m ready to say &#8220;goodbye&#8221;. If you don&#8217;t know, they have even come up with an effective link rejector. They themselves said it best&#8230; what do spammers register everywhere for?.. duh! to post links.. The links rejector will phase through their links of garbage.</p>
<p>So why am I here? I&#8217;m certainly not here to compete. The folks at bbantispam certainly have a legitimate and effective  product on their hands. I&#8217;m here to introduce, rather humbly, a little project of mine.</p>
<p>Introducing Forum Spammer List, or FSpamlist for short.  This, in a nutshell, is an online database full of known spammer&#8217;s email addresses, popular domains, usernames, and IP addresses that are all easily exportable so that forum administrators can import them into their forum&#8217;s ban lists.  With your help, this database can grow and stay current to aid in forum administrators everywhere to stop known spammers from even registering. Well, how can you help you might ask? This online database can be updated by anyone, anywhere. Well what about false-positives, JACK! Well, that&#8217;s when you&#8217;ve got to trust me&#8230; I&#8217;ve set-up a few security measures to keep the spammers out and the legitimates in. See a name in the database that looks like it shouldn&#8217;t be there?&#8230;just flag it using the link in the spammer profile page and the volunteer team and I will take a look it.</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;ve said a lot&#8230; I&#8217;ve just pulled a shameless plug haven&#8217;t I? I wouldn&#8217;t like to think so.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve come all this way to make a proposal to the folks at bbantispam. I, myself, have installed the Textual Confirmation tool on my forum. It works quite well might I add, and I noticed in the Readme (and in your bbantispam&#8217;s forum) that in the free version of the Textual Confirmation tool actually sends back the spammer&#8217;s data to bbantispam that gets the confirmation prompt wrong. I am proposing that on future feedback reports, that information would also be sent to FSpamlist for holding, and my team and I will look at the data and decide whether it is valid and should therefore be inserted into the database. Why would you do this for us? Well, I thought we are here to stop spam any way we can. <em>But</em>, I do understand the logic of barter, or partnerships if you would. This would be the first partnership of its kind. What I am offering you is complete and utter credit for all data sent to FSpamlist. Those exact terms are open to discussion.</p>
<p>Well, there I&#8217;ve said it.. I&#8217;m just one fishhook in a sea of spammers.</p>

					<p>The <a href="http://bbantispam.com/">bbAntiSpam tools</a> (Links Rejector, Textual Confirmation and Advanced Textual Confirmation) exist for more than one year now. While working on the tools and marketing them, I sometimes find very useful and interesting resources, and I&#8217;d like to share the link. Before, I wrote about findings in bbAntiSpam forums, but my postings were lost in the support requests. Now, I finally started this blog.</p>
<p>Actually, there is a number of blogs which cover the spambot topic. Some of them are in the blogroll. But I&#8217;m sure that bbSpam blog will get the leading position fast because I have a lot to say, many opinions are based on <i>experience</i> and, what also counts, I&#8217;m going to promote the blog.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to be the only author and I plan to hire a pair of assistants. The idea is that one person can&#8217;t cover everything. Worse, one person can overlook an interesting topic. Therefore, new authors are always welcome. If you want to say anything, don&#8217;t hesitate to contact me, I&#8217;ll create an account for you. Self-promotion is ok if it is written in the human language, not in the marketing language.</p>
