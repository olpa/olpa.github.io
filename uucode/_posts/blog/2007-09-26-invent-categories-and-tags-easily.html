<p>My <a href="http://bbspam.com/">antispam blog</a> passed 25+ posts, it was enough introduce the categories. But when I started to categorize the posts, I stuck with it. After inventing four topics, I had no more ideas. I though I'm not alone in such trouble, searched in Internet for advices what to do.</p>
<p>The best I found is "<a href="http://www.blogherald.com/2007/06/29/blog-post-category-trauma-how-to-help-bloggers-with-useless-categories/">Blog Post Category Trauma: How To Help Bloggers With Useless Categories</a>". Unfortunately, this text explans only that bloggers have to have good categories, but doesn't explain how to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>Finally, I invented an ultimate method. Inventing categories and tags (labels) is no more a problem.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudyard_Kipling">Kipling</a>, The Elephant's Child:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>I keep six honest serving-men<br />
(They taught me all I knew);<br />
Their names are What and Why and When<br />
And How and Where and Who.<br />
I send them over land and sea,<br />
I send them east and west;<br />
But after they have worked for me,<br />
I give them all a rest.</p>
<p>I let them rest from nine till five,<br />
For I am busy then,<br />
As well as breakfast, lunch, and tea,<br />
For they are hungry men.<br />
But different folk have different views;<br />
I know a person small-<br />
She keeps ten million serving-men,<br />
Who get no rest at all!</p>
<p>She sends'em abroad on her own affairs,<br />
From the second she opens her eyes-<br />
One million Hows, two million Wheres,<br />
And seven million Whys!<br />
</i></p></blockquote>
<p>This verse inspired me to try this method:</p>
<p>* Print all the post titles.<br />
* Near each title, write a one-word comments about content of the post, answering the questions "what, why, when, how, where and who".<br />
* If the same word or its synonym is used for three posts, it's a category.</p>
<p>And yes, this method worked fine. I easily got 11 categories.</p>
<p>What's more important is that the method helps to realize categories which can't be found by usual thinking. For example, I even didn't suspect I have category "usability".</p>
