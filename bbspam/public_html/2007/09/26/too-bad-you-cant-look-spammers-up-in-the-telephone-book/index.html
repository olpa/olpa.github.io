				<div class="KonaBody"><p>Wouldn’t it be great if you could get access to an automatically maintained list of forum spammers and simply check each new member against it before you allowed someone to register or create a new post? Well you kind of can do that, to some extent, but you may not want to. Here’s why…</p>
<p><span id="more-35"></span></p>
<p>There are some BB anti-spam protection schemes out there that rely upon third-party spam reports to build a list of persona non grata in the forum community. I <a href="../../../07/25/what-is-askimet/index.html">already wrote about Akismet</a>, and you may have heard about another site called <a href="http://www.bbprotection.net/">bbProtection</a>. While Akisment focuses on the message, bbProtection focuses on the messenger by building a “blacklist&#8221; of bad guys as reported by other bbProtection users.</p>
<p>Whether you use a message-based program like Akismet, or you go for the blacklist method that bbProtection offers, you are depending upon a third party to decide whether or not a particular person or message is welcome on your site. </p>
<p>And it’s not really a third “party&#8221; you are depending on. It’s just a software program that at the end up the day is doing nothing more than crunching through some probability algorithms, or browsing a “suspect list&#8221; and making a decision that affects the quality of the service that you deliver to your members and visitors. That’s not the way to build a thriving forum or blog community.</p>
<p>What if someone mounts an attack against a particular blogger because of a difference in opinion or a conflicting political view? All it takes is a few well-placed spam complaints to a service like bbProtection and a perfectly innocent person ends up having his reputation smeared and his access blocked around the Internet. That’s not the way to build a thriving forum or blog community either.</p>
<p>There are some potential legal problems that could be laying in wait to ambush users of products like bbProtection as well. I’ll tell you about those in my next post.</p>
