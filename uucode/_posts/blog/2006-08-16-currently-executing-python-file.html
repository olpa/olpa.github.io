<p>Here is a way to get the currently executing Python file:</p>
<pre>print (lambda x:x).func_code.co_filename</pre>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Probably there is a simpler way, but I haven't found it. The best alternative I found is to use the special attribute <tt>__file__</tt>, but it doesn't work for SConscript files:</p>
<pre>print (lambda x:x).func_code.co_filename
print __file__</pre>
<p>results is</p>
<pre>/home/olpa/p/.../SConscript.py
/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/SCons/Script/__init__.pyc</pre>
