<p>My advice: do use the "second shot" option. At least, I failed to pass the first attempt and had to try again. What was wrong:</p>
<p>* I needed time to adapt myself to the testing interface, and probably made something wrong in several first exercises.<br />
* A few tasks are a bit unusual and I spent too much time on them. You should remember them and do homework.<br />
* I work bad under under time pressure.</p>
<p>The best preparation resource I found is this youtube transcript: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mm31GLUiNE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mm31GLUiNE</a>. It is in French, but everything is clear, especially after the first certification attempt.</p>
<p>On the second attempt, passed. 918 out of 1000 is more than enough.</p>
