<p>A news which should have been posted a month ago. <a href="http://uucode.com/blog/2005/06/08/xsieve-is-submitted-to-google-summer-of-code/">XSieve proposal</a> became one of the <a href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html">Google Summer of Code</a> projects. Due to visiting <a href="http://wiki.di.uminho.pt/wiki/bin/view/GTTSE/">GTTSE 2005</a> and travelling, I've lost a month. Fortunately, I have some code written, so I hope to meet deadline well. </p>
