<p>I've spent some time trying to nicely format an GPL excerpt in LaTeX. The problem is that the all-caps text of the "no warrantly" section doesn't fit to the TeX rules well. Finally, I gave up and decided to find out how this problem is handled by other people. I found the GNU General Public License (GPL) <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.tex">in LaTeX format</a> on the official site gnu.org. Surprise! They don't have a solution, they have a workaround. The all-caps text is converted to normal text. I like it. The workaround is adopted.</p>
