<p>I started to use CJK in LaTeX recently, and I spend a lot of time trying to fix the following problem:</p>
<pre>! Font C70/song/m/n/9/65=cyberb65 at 9.0pt not loadable:
                         Metric (TFM) file not found.

? 
</to></pre>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>I searched Internet to find a fix. I'm not the only one who got such error, but the only recommendation was to correctly install CJK fonts. Unfortunately, it wasn't my case. My CJK fonts were installed and worked.</p>
<p>Finally, I've traced the source of the problem and fixed it.</p>
<p>I use background texts which are produced in <tt>\EveryShipout</tt>. The text should be displayed in Helvetica font, so the shipout code contains:</p>
<pre>... \\fontfamily{phv}\\selectfont ...</pre>
<p>Now let's trace TeX execution. It processes CJK text, and the current encoding is some "CXX". A page is full, so shipout procedure is activated. "Selectfont" tries to load "phv" for "CXX" encoding (font shape "CXX/phv/m/n"). It's undefined, so fallback is "CXX/song/m/n", which somehow is translated to "cyberbXX" (my CJK font), and for some reason it is not found (altough exists).</p>
<p>The fix is simple. The shipout code should also define the font encoding:</p>
<pre>... \\fontfamily{phv}\\fontencoding{T1}\\selectfont ...</pre>
<p>All this seems obvious now, but it wasn't easy to realize. TeX error message is very misleading: error context is the source code, not the shipout code.</p>

<p>An example to reproduce the problem. Note that I really need to use "set@typeset@protect", therwise font changing commands doesn't work.</p>
