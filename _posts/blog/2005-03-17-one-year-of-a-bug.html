<p>A year ago I wrote a script for managing reusable components in FrameMaker. It has being expensively used. Saying more, it's a core of a new workflow.</p>
<p>Recently users reported a bug. Their comments for components where not displaying.</p>
<p>After some exploration, I realized that comments <i>never</i> were used by the code. At the time of writing the script there were no comments and even no agreement on how to make comments, so I implemented a fallback behaviour (using the first paragraph of a component as the comment).</p>
<p>All the year the users were getting the fallback behavior, and it was right!</p>
