<p>I'm sad I didn't find the article &#8220;<a href="http://www.masanjin.net/~wmorgan/IncorporatingGuileIntoYourCProgram.txt">Incorporating Guile into your C program</a>&#8221; before. It would save me a lot of time. Although the author annotates the article as &#8220;a old howto I wrote (very probably terribly out of date at this point as I gave up on Guile a long time ago)&#8221;, the article is still correct and very useful (especially in the GC part).</p>
<h2>1 October 2005, update</h2>
<p>The document is inaccessable today due to problems with the server. Instead, the document can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.glug.org/docbits/">Unofficial Guile Docbits</a>.</p>
