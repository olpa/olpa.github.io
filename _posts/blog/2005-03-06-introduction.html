<p>Why I've started the blog? What I plan to write?</p>
<p>The answer is simple: it's all about the marketing of my software.</p>
<p>I work on several open source projects which are quite good. Unfortunately, they are not popular yet. I hope that if the blog becomes popular, then the projects become popular too.</p>
<p>The second. My projects are interrelated, but users sometimes miss it. The blog can make them aware of my other products.</p>
<p>The next point is the feedback. I can write about plans of development and possible features, and you can comment on it or suggest ideas.</p>
<p>There are some other reasons, but I can't remember them.</p>
<p>The most comprehensive list of my projects is on my home page: <a href="http://uucode.com/">http://uucode.com/</a><br />
Some projects are listed on SourceForge: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/users/olpa/">http://sourceforge.net/users/olpa/</a></p>
<p>By the way, I also have a blog in Russian language: <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/olpa/">http://www.livejournal.com/users/olpa/</a></p>
<p>And the last note: don't hesitate to correct my English. I'd be happy to fix errors.</p>
