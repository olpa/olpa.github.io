<p>Recently I got an <a href="http://xtech.org/">XTech</a> 2006 speaker notification. It said that acceptance or rejection notifications would be sent this week, and some more papers would be selected at the week of 27 February and later.</p>
<p>I believe that <a href="http://uucode.com/blog/2006/01/08/yet-another-submission-xtech-2006/">my XSieve proposal</a> isn't in the category "undoubtedly should be rejected", but I don't expect it's in the category "definitely should be accepted". I think it's somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>I surmise that XTech reviewers might read my blog, so I'd like to incentive you: vote for XSieve acceptance! XSieve isn't a revolution in XML world, but it's anyway an important milestone and worth to be popularized.</p>
