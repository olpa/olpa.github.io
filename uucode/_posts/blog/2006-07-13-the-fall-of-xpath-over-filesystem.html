<p>Many XPath tutorials use file paths as an analogy of XPath. While it is ok from a high-level point of view, the analogy is misleading and actual technical implementations (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpguide/html/cpconXPathNavigatorOverDifferentStores.asp">one</a>, <a href="http://dret.net/projects/fsx/">another</a>, <a href="http://uucode.com/texts/xfind/index.html">my</a>) are kludge (at least, my implementation). Here are some issues.<br />
<!--more--><br />
The first one is the user interface. When a node (a file) is matched, what should be printed to the user:</p>
<p><tt>/usr/bin/find</tt>, or<br />
<tt>../../../../bin/find</tt>?</p>
<p>Other issues are technical.</p>
<p>The second issue. The file system isn't a tree. There are symbolic links. On the one hand, as user, I want that XPath "<tt>.//*[match(name(),'*.c')]</tt>" find matches in the folder "src", even if this folder is actually a symbolic link. On the other hand, symbolic links can create hardly detectable infinite loops.</p>
<p>Third. File systems have many features. One of them allows to create a folder, for which one can't get the list of the children files, but one can enter to a subdirectory if the name is known. Let's have a site in the folder "<tt>/var/web/pub/uVc7k/</tt>" and "pub" is a such folder. Then XPath "<tt>//*[match(name(),'*.html')]</tt>" doesn't find HTML files of the site.</p>
<p>Fourth. XPath tutorials suggest nice XPath expressions like "<tt>/usr/bin/find</tt>". Unfortunately, actual expressions look like <tt>/node[name()='usr']/node[name()='bin']/node[name()='find']</tt>. Indeed, file names are not limited to the ASCII letters and digits.</p>
<p>Fifth, the situation is even worse. Many file systems allow to use any characters for file names, excluding "\000" and "/", but including the symbols with codes "\001", "\002" etc, which are forbidden in XML.</p>
<p>Sixth. Finally, the main. I just don't see what a practical problem can be solved using XPath over file system. I hope I overlooked something.</p>
