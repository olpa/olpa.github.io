<p>I wanted to add my own recursive target in addition to the recursive targets produced by automake. It was not easy.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>At the first glance, it was an easy task. Generated Makefiles have a variable RECURSIVE_TARGETS with the list of the recursive targets. The only thing to do is to add my target to the list. Unfortunately, I failed.</p>
<p>Anyway, I found a possible solution. Now all automake files begins the following way:</p>
<pre>## Makefile.am -- Process this file with automake to produce Makefile.in
include @top_srcdir@/config/xsieve.mk</pre>
<p>For my recursive target "html", common file "config/xsieve.mk" defines the following:</p>
<pre>
html-recursive:

ifneq ($(RECURSIVE_TARGETS),html-recursive)
html-recursive:
	$(MAKE) $(AM_MAKEFLAGS) RECURSIVE_TARGETS=html-recursive html-recursive
endif

html: html-recursive html-am

html-am: html-local

html-local:
</pre>
<p>For the default recursive traversing, all standard targets should be defined: "html", "html-recursive", "html-am", "html-local".</p>
<p>The target "html" is an entry point.</p>
<p>I don't know what the target "html-am" is supposed to do. Probably "-am" targets are for internal use of automake. It is called when the variable "SUBDIRS" is not defined.</p>
<p>I might be wrong, but I think that for user actions should be performed in "html-local".</p>
<p>The most non-trivial moment is defining "html-recursive". I can't add the target name to the variable "RECURSIVE_TARGETS", but I can re-run make and specify anything what I want.</p>
